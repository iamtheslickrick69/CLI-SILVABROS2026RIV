# How Do I Choose a Solar Company in California? Red Flags to Avoid

**The short answer: Choose an established local installer with in-house crews, strong warranties, transparent pricing, and no high-pressure sales tactics.** The wrong solar company can cost you thousands in problems, delays, or inferior equipment. Here's how to identify quality installers and avoid the red flags.

## The Stakes Are High

A solar system is a 25+ year investment. The wrong choice means:
- Equipment that underperforms or fails
- Warranty claims that go unanswered
- Installation problems causing roof damage
- Companies that disappear before you need service

The right choice means:
- Decades of reliable savings
- Professional installation that protects your home
- Responsive service when questions arise
- Equipment backed by real warranties

## What to Look For: Green Flags

### 1. Established Local Presence

**What to check:**
- How long in business? (5+ years preferred)
- Physical office in California?
- Local references available?

**Why it matters:**
Local companies stake their reputation on every install. They're not going anywhere. National lead-generation companies may prioritize volume over quality.

### 2. In-House Installation Crews

**What to ask:** "Do you use your own employees or subcontractors?"

**Best answer:** "Our own certified installers. No subcontractors."

**Why it matters:**
- In-house crews = consistent quality
- Subcontractors = variable quality, accountability issues
- Who do you call if something goes wrong?

### 3. Strong Warranty Terms

**What to look for:**
| Component | Good Warranty | Great Warranty |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Panels | 25 years | 25 years |
| Inverter | 12 years | 25 years |
| Workmanship | 10 years | 25 years |
| Roof penetrations | 10 years | 25 years |

**Why it matters:**
Warranties are only as good as the company backing them. A 25-year warranty from a company that folds in 5 years is worthless.

### 4. Transparent, Itemized Pricing

**What to request:** Written quote breaking down:
- Equipment costs (panels, inverter, racking)
- Labor costs
- Permit fees
- Any additional costs

**Red flag:** "We don't provide itemized quotes."

**Why it matters:**
Transparent pricing lets you compare apples to apples. Hidden costs indicate potential problems.

### 5. Quality Equipment Brands

**Tier 1 panel brands:** QCells, REC, Silfab, Canadian Solar, Panasonic, SunPower
**Quality inverters:** Enphase, SolarEdge, SMA, Tesla
**Quality batteries:** Tesla, Enphase, Franklin, Generac

**Why it matters:**
Equipment quality affects performance and warranty backing. Unknown brands may not exist in 10 years.

### 6. Proper Licensing and Certifications

**California requirements:**
- CSLB License (C-10 or C-46)
- General Liability Insurance
- Workers' Compensation Insurance

**Certifications to look for:**
- NABCEP (North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners)
- Tesla Certified Installer
- Manufacturer certifications

### 7. Multiple Financing Options

**Good companies offer:**
- Cash purchase
- Multiple loan providers
- Lease/PPA (if you want it)

**Why it matters:**
A company pushing only one financing option may be prioritizing their profit over your best interest.

## Red Flags: What to Avoid

### Red Flag 1: High-Pressure Sales Tactics

**Warning signs:**
- "This price is only good today"
- "We only have 3 spots left this month"
- "Sign now or lose the discount"
- Won't leave a written quote

**Reality:**
Solar is a major purchase. Any company pressuring you to decide immediately is prioritizing their sale over your best interest.

### Red Flag 2: Too-Good-to-Be-True Pricing

**Warning signs:**
- Dramatically lower than other quotes
- "We're running a special promotion"
- Won't explain how they're cheaper

**Reality:**
They're cutting corners somewhere—equipment quality, installation shortcuts, thin warranties, or inexperienced labor.

### Red Flag 3: Vague Equipment Specifications

**Warning signs:**
- "We use top-quality panels"
- Won't name specific brands
- "We use whatever's available"

**Reality:**
If they won't tell you what equipment they're installing, there's a reason. You might get whatever's cheapest.

### Red Flag 4: No Local Office or References

**Warning signs:**
- Sales rep is from out of state
- Can't provide local customer references
- No physical office you can visit

**Reality:**
If something goes wrong, who do you call? Out-of-area companies may be impossible to reach for warranty service.

### Red Flag 5: Subcontractor-Heavy Operations

**Warning signs:**
- "We work with trusted partners"
- Different crews for different installs
- Can't tell you who will install your system

**Reality:**
Subcontractors can be excellent or terrible—you don't know which you'll get. Quality control suffers with revolving crews.

### Red Flag 6: Pushy About Leasing

**Warning signs:**
- Only offers lease/PPA options
- Dismisses questions about buying
- Downplays value of owning

**Reality:**
Lease-only companies don't sell equipment—they finance it. Their incentives don't align with your best interest.

### Red Flag 7: Unrealistic Production Claims

**Warning signs:**
- "Your system will produce X" (much higher than others quote)
- "You'll have zero electric bill"
- Won't explain how they calculated production

**Reality:**
Inflated production estimates set you up for disappointment. Legitimate companies use industry-standard calculation methods.

### Red Flag 8: Poor Communication

**Warning signs:**
- Slow to respond to questions
- Can't explain things clearly
- Passes you between multiple contacts

**Reality:**
If communication is bad during sales (when they want your business), imagine how it'll be after they have your money.

## How to Compare Quotes

### Get 3 Quotes Minimum

More quotes help you:
- Identify outliers (too high or too low)
- Compare equipment options
- Evaluate companies' responsiveness

### Compare Apples to Apples

| Factor | Quote 1 | Quote 2 | Quote 3 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| System size (kW) | | | |
| Panel brand/model | | | |
| Inverter type | | | |
| Battery (if any) | | | |
| Price per watt | | | |
| Workmanship warranty | | | |
| Estimated production | | | |

### Price Per Watt Calculation

```
Price per watt = Total cost ÷ System size in watts
```

Example: $28,000 ÷ 8,000 watts = $3.50/watt

This lets you compare different-sized systems fairly.

---

## The Cheapest Quote Isn't Always Best

### Why Lowest Price Can Cost More:

**Short term:**
- Inferior equipment fails sooner
- Sloppy installation causes problems
- Company may not exist for warranty claims

**Long term:**
- Lower production = less savings
- Repairs out of pocket
- Replacement costs

### Value Calculation:

| Company | Price | Est. Production | $/kWh over 25 years |
|---------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Budget | $22,000 | 9,000 kWh/yr | $0.098 |
| Mid-tier | $26,000 | 11,000 kWh/yr | $0.095 |
| Premium | $32,000 | 12,000 kWh/yr | $0.107 |

The mid-tier option actually costs LESS per kWh produced.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are big national companies better than local installers?
Not necessarily. Large national companies may offer strong backing but often use subcontractors and have less responsive service. Quality local companies often provide better installation and service.

### How do I verify a contractor's license?
Visit the California Contractors State License Board (CSLB) website: cslb.ca.gov. Enter the company name or license number to verify status and check for complaints.

### Should I choose based on price or reputation?
Reputation first, then price among reputable options. A low-priced installation from a sketchy company can cost you far more in the long run.

### What if a company goes out of business?
Equipment warranties (panels, inverters) are typically backed by manufacturers, not installers. Workmanship warranties, however, become worthless. Choose established companies less likely to disappear.

### Do I need to get quotes in person?
Not necessarily. Many companies provide accurate remote quotes using satellite imagery. However, a site visit before final contract ensures nothing is missed.

### How important are online reviews?
Important but not definitive. Look for patterns—consistent praise or complaints. A few negative reviews among many positives is normal. All negative reviews is a red flag.
