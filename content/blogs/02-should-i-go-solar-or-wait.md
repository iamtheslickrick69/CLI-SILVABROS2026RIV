# Should I Go Solar or Wait? A Decision Guide for California Homeowners

**The short answer: For most California homeowners, waiting costs more than going solar now.** With rates increasing 7-9% annually, the 30% federal tax credit locked in through 2032, and solar equipment prices stabilized, delaying typically means paying thousands more to your utility while gaining little advantage.

> **Quick Summary:** Every month you wait, you're paying rising utility rates instead of a fixed solar payment. A 6-month delay typically costs $1,500-3,000 in lost savings. The "perfect time" is when your roof is ready and your bill is high enough—for most Californians, that's now.

## The Real Cost of Waiting: California Numbers

Let's do the math for a typical Inland Empire homeowner:

### If Your Current Bill Is $350/Month (SCE Average for 2,500 sq ft):

| Timeline | What Happens | Money Paid to Utility |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Today | Your current bill | $350 |
| +6 months | 4% rate increase hits | $364/month |
| +12 months | Another 4% increase | $379/month |
| +24 months | Compounded increases | $410/month |

**Total paid to utility while "waiting" 2 years: $9,180**

That money is gone forever. It doesn't build equity. It doesn't come back.

### Meanwhile, If You Go Solar Today:

| Timeline | Monthly Payment | What You're Building |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Month 1 | $185 solar payment | Equity in your system |
| Month 6 | $185 (fixed) | Home value increasing |
| Month 12 | $185 (still fixed) | Protection from rate hikes |
| Month 24 | $185 (locked in) | Path to free electricity |

**Total paid toward solar over 2 years: $4,440** (and you own an asset worth $20,000+)

### The Comparison:

| Choice | 2-Year Cost | What You Have After |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Wait | $9,180 to utility | Nothing |
| Go solar | $4,440 to solar loan | System worth $20,000+ |

**Waiting cost you an extra $4,740**—plus you're two years further from payoff.

## Real Homeowners Who Waited (And Wish They Hadn't)

**Jennifer & Mike Orozco — Rancho Cucamonga, CA**
> "We talked about solar for three years. THREE YEARS. We paid SCE over $14,000 during that time. Our system cost $19,000 after the tax credit. We basically paid for half our system in utility bills while we were 'thinking about it.'"

**Robert Kim — Moreno Valley, CA**
> "I kept waiting for prices to drop. They didn't. But my bill went up 23% in two years. I finally pulled the trigger when I saw my summer bill hit $489. Should have done it when it was $380."

**Amanda Torres — Corona, CA**
> "My husband wanted to wait until we 'had more saved up.' But our $0-down payment is $40 less than our old electric bill was. We've been saving money since month one. Waiting made zero sense."

## Arguments for Going Solar NOW

### 1. The 30% Federal Tax Credit Is Guaranteed Through 2032

The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) gives you 30% of your system cost back as a tax credit. On a $30,000 system, that's **$9,000 back**.

**But here's what many people miss:** The credit hasn't always been 30%. It dropped to 26% in 2020 and was scheduled to fall further before Congress extended it. There's no guarantee future legislation won't change the timeline again.

| Year | Tax Credit | Your Risk |
|------|------------|-----------|
| 2026 | 30% | Locked in |
| 2027-2032 | 30% | Locked in |
| 2033 | 26% | Scheduled |
| 2034 | 22% | Scheduled |
| 2035+ | 0% | Current law |

Locking in 30% now eliminates political risk.

### 2. California Rates Are Climbing Faster Than Anywhere Else

California utilities have filed for—and received—consistent rate increases:

| Utility | 2020 Rate | 2026 Rate | Increase | Annual % |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| SDG&E | 27¢ | 55¢ | +104% | +12.6%/year |
| PG&E | 23¢ | 45¢ | +96% | +11.8%/year |
| SCE | 21¢ | 42¢ | +100% | +12.2%/year |

**These aren't predictions—they're what actually happened.** And both utilities have filed for additional increases in 2027.

### 3. NEM 3.0 Is Settled—No Point Waiting It Out

Some homeowners hoped NEM 3.0 would be reversed or improved. Here's the reality:

- NEM 3.0 was approved after extensive lobbying
- It's now settled policy with no serious repeal efforts
- Waiting for "better" net metering is waiting for something that isn't coming

**The smart move:** Design your system for NEM 3.0 reality (solar + battery) and move forward.

### 4. Solar Equipment Prices Have Stabilized

Between 2010 and 2020, solar panel prices dropped dramatically:

| Year | Price per Watt | Drop from 2010 |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| 2010 | $7.50 | — |
| 2015 | $4.00 | -47% |
| 2020 | $2.80 | -63% |
| 2023 | $3.00 | -60% |
| 2026 | $3.20-3.50 | -53% to -57% |

**Notice:** Prices actually increased slightly from 2020 to 2026 due to supply chain issues and inflation. The era of dramatic price drops is over.

You're not going to see 50% price reductions like the early 2010s. The savings from waiting for "cheaper panels" are minimal compared to what you'll pay your utility in the meantime.

### 5. California Blackout Season Is Getting Worse

PSPS (Public Safety Power Shutoff) events affected:
- 2019: 2.5 million customers
- 2020: 1.3 million customers
- 2021: 1.1 million customers
- 2022: 1.8 million customers
- 2023: 2.1 million customers
- 2024: 3.2 million customers

**The trend is worsening.** Climate change means more fire risk means more shutoffs.

Solar + battery means you're not sitting in the dark while your neighbors scramble for flashlights.

## Arguments for Waiting (And Why They're Usually Wrong)

### "My Roof Needs Replacement Soon"

**If your roof has less than 7-10 years of life left:** Yes, replace it first. Removing and reinstalling panels adds $2,000-4,000 to the cost.

**But be honest with yourself:** Is your roof actually bad, or is this just an excuse to delay? Many roofs have 15+ years left but owners assume they need replacement.

**Get a roof inspection** (often free). Know the actual condition before using this as a reason to wait.

### "I'm Selling My Home Soon"

**If you're selling within 18 months:** Probably wait. The value increase is real, but timing is uncertain.

**If you're selling in 2-5 years:** Solar likely still makes sense. Studies show:
- Solar homes sell for 4-6% more
- Solar homes sell 20% faster
- Buyers actively seek solar homes in California

**The math:** If your home is worth $600,000 and solar adds 4%, that's $24,000 in added value. If your system costs $20,000 net, you come out ahead even if you sell in year 2.

### "I Should Wait for Better Technology"

Every year, someone says: "I'll wait for the next generation of panels."

**Reality check:**

| Technology | 2020 | 2026 | Improvement |
|------------|------|------|-------------|
| Panel efficiency | 20% | 22% | +10% |
| Battery density | Good | Slightly better | +15% |
| Inverter efficiency | 97% | 98% | +1% |

These are incremental improvements, not revolutionary leaps. Waiting 3 years for 10% more efficiency while paying $12,000+ to your utility makes no financial sense.

### "Interest Rates Are High—I'll Wait for Them to Drop"

**Current solar loan rates:** 6-9%

**But consider:** While you wait for rates to drop 1-2%, your utility rates are rising 8-10% per year.

**The math:**
- Wait 1 year for rates to drop from 7% to 6%
- Pay utility $4,200 during that year
- Save ~$2,000 in interest over 25 years
- **Net loss: $2,200** by waiting

You can also refinance later if rates drop significantly.

## A Framework for Your Decision

Answer these questions honestly:

### 1. Is your monthly electric bill over $150?
- **Yes:** Solar almost certainly makes financial sense
- **No:** Savings may not justify the investment

### 2. Do you plan to stay in your home 5+ years?
- **Yes:** You'll capture the full benefit
- **No:** Consider your timeline carefully

### 3. Is your roof in good condition (10+ years remaining)?
- **Yes:** You're ready for solar
- **No:** Address the roof first (or do roof + solar together)

### 4. Can you use the 30% tax credit?
- **Yes, I have tax liability:** You'll save thousands
- **No, I have very low taxes:** Explore lease options or equity programs

### 5. Are you tired of rate increases and blackout anxiety?
- **Yes:** Solar + battery solves both
- **No:** (Seriously, who isn't tired of this?)

**Score yourself:**
- 4-5 "Yes" answers: Go solar now
- 2-3 "Yes" answers: Get a consultation to explore options
- 0-1 "Yes" answers: Waiting might be appropriate

## What If Rates Drop or Technology Improves?

Some people worry: "What if I go solar and then something better comes along?"

### Reality Check #1: Rates Have Never Dropped
California utility rates have increased every single year for decades. Not once have they decreased. Waiting for rate relief is waiting for something that has never happened.

### Reality Check #2: You're Not Locked Out of Future Tech
- You can add batteries later
- You can expand your system later
- You can upgrade inverters later

Solar installations are modular. Future improvements can be incorporated.

### Reality Check #3: Your Savings Start Immediately
Every month of solar production is money not sent to your utility. That's real, tangible value you capture now.

## Real Talk: The Urgency Factor

Be skeptical of any solar company that pressures you with false urgency:
- "This price is only good today!" (It's not.)
- "The tax credit is ending!" (It's guaranteed through 2032.)
- "We only have 3 spots left this month!" (They don't.)

**Real urgency looks like this:**
- Your utility bills are real money leaving your account every month
- Rate increases are documented, ongoing, and accelerating
- PSPS blackouts are increasing in frequency and duration
- Your roof is aging, and the window for easy installation narrows each year

The decision should be yours, on your timeline, with no high-pressure tactics.

## Key Takeaways

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "Prices will drop more" | Prices have stabilized—not dropping |
| "I'll wait for better tech" | Improvements are incremental, not revolutionary |
| "Interest rates are too high" | Utility rate increases outpace interest costs |
| "NEM 3.0 killed solar" | Solar + battery is still highly profitable |
| "I should wait for..." | Every month waiting = money to utility |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I wait for solar panel prices to drop more?
No. Solar panel prices have stabilized and even increased slightly since 2020 due to supply chain factors and inflation. The dramatic drops of 2010-2020 are over. Meanwhile, utility rates continue rising 8-10% annually.

### Will the federal tax credit increase again?
Unlikely. The 30% credit is already generous by historical standards. It's more likely to decrease (as scheduled in 2033) than increase. Locking in 30% now is the safe play.

### What if NEM 3.0 changes?
Current NEM 3.0 rules are locked in for 9 years from your installation date. Even if future policies change, you're protected. And changes would likely be for new installations, not existing systems.

### Should I wait until I can afford to pay cash?
Not necessarily. Solar loans with $0 down often have monthly payments lower than your current electric bill—meaning you save money from day one while owning the system.

### What if I'm not sure how long I'll stay in my home?
Solar homes sell for 4-6% more and sell faster than comparable non-solar homes. Even if you move in 3-4 years, you'll likely recoup your investment through the higher sale price.

### Is there ever a "perfect" time to go solar?
The perfect time is when: your roof is in good shape, your electric bill is substantial, you plan to stay awhile, and you can use the tax credit. For most California homeowners paying $150+/month, that perfect time is now.
