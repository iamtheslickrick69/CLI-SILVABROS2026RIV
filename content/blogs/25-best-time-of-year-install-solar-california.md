# What Is the Best Time of Year to Install Solar in California?

**The short answer: The best time to install solar in California is 2-3 months before summer.** Installing in spring (March-May) means your system is producing by June when bills peak. However, solar makes sense year-round—waiting for "perfect timing" costs more in utility bills than you'd gain. Here's the complete seasonal breakdown.

## The Short Answer: Install Before Summer

California's highest electricity usage—and bills—hit during summer months:

| Month | Typical Usage | Typical Bill |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| January | Low | $200 |
| April | Moderate | $250 |
| July | High | $450 |
| August | Highest | $500+ |
| October | Moderate | $280 |

**Installing in spring captures summer savings.** If you sign in March, your system is typically producing by late May or June—right when you need it most.

## Seasonal Installation Pros and Cons

### Spring (March - May): Best Overall

**Pros:**
- System active before summer peak
- Moderate weather for installation
- Less permit backlog than summer
- Capture full summer savings

**Cons:**
- Popular season = slightly longer wait times
- Spring storms may cause minor delays

**Verdict:** Ideal timing for most homeowners.

### Summer (June - August): High Demand Season

**Pros:**
- Longest days = maximum production once installed
- Clear weather for installation
- Immediate high savings

**Cons:**
- Highest demand = longer permitting
- Crews are busiest = potential scheduling delays
- You've already missed some summer savings if you sign late

**Verdict:** Still excellent, but act early in the season.

### Fall (September - November): Overlooked Sweet Spot

**Pros:**
- Lower demand = faster processing
- Still good production
- Ready for next summer
- End-of-year tax credit planning

**Cons:**
- Some savings delayed until following summer
- Fire season may affect some areas (PSPS)

**Verdict:** Great time to install—less competition, smooth process.

### Winter (December - February): Lowest Production, But...

**Pros:**
- Shortest wait times
- Installers offer best availability
- System ready for spring/summer
- Tax credit applies to year of installation

**Cons:**
- Fewer daylight hours = lower immediate production
- Rain may delay installation days
- Shorter days mean slower permit processing

**Verdict:** Fine time to install—lower production is temporary.

## The Real Math: Why "Waiting" Costs Money

Many people ask: "Should I wait until spring to install?"

Let's do the math:

### Scenario: It's October. You could install now or wait until March.

**Option A: Install in October**
- System producing by December
- December-May production: 3,500 kWh
- Savings: ~$1,400
- **You're $1,400 ahead by the time March arrives**

**Option B: Wait until March**
- Sign contract in March
- System producing by May/June
- December-May utility bills: $1,400+ paid to utility
- **That money is gone forever**

**The cost of waiting 5 months: $1,400**

There's no perfect time to install solar. The best time is **as soon as you decide it makes sense**.

## How Installation Timing Affects Savings

### Year 1 Savings by Sign Date:

| Sign Date | Active By | Year 1 Savings |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| January | March | $3,800 |
| March | May | $3,600 |
| May | July | $2,800 |
| July | September | $2,200 |
| September | November | $3,200* |
| November | January | $3,600* |

*Captures full following summer

### The Pattern:
- Sign early in year → Capture current year summer
- Sign mid-year → Miss some summer savings
- Sign late in year → Capture full following year

**No matter when you sign, your 25-year savings are similar.** Timing mainly affects Year 1.

---

## Weather and Installation

### Can Panels Be Installed in Rain?

No. For safety reasons, installation is postponed during rain. However:
- California's dry season is long (May-October)
- Rain delays are typically 1-2 days
- Your timeline may shift slightly, not significantly

### What About Extreme Heat?

Installers work through hot days but may adjust schedules:
- Early morning starts
- Midday breaks during peak heat
- Completion in afternoon

This doesn't typically affect your timeline.

### Fire Season Considerations

In high-risk fire zones during October-November:
- PSPS events may pause work temporarily
- Air quality alerts may affect scheduling
- Generally minor impact on total timeline

---

## Permitting Seasonality

Permit processing times vary by season:

| Season | Typical Permit Time | Why |
|--------|---------------------|-----|
| Spring | 3-4 weeks | Moderate demand |
| Summer | 4-6 weeks | High demand, vacation schedules |
| Fall | 2-4 weeks | Lower demand |
| Winter | 2-3 weeks | Lowest demand |

**Fall and winter installations often move faster** due to reduced permit backlogs.

---

## Tax Credit Timing

The 30% federal tax credit applies based on when your system is **placed in service** (turned on).

### Year-End Considerations:

**If you want the credit on THIS year's taxes:**
- Sign by October for best chance
- System must be operational before December 31
- Permit delays can push into next year

**If you miss this year:**
- Credit still applies—just on next year's return
- No financial penalty, just timing shift
- Don't rush and compromise quality

### Example:
- Sign in November 2026
- System active in January 2027
- Claim credit on 2027 taxes (filed in early 2028)

---

## Utility Rate Timing

California utilities file rate changes at set intervals:

### When Rates Typically Increase:
- January 1 (annual adjustments)
- Summer rate structures begin (varies by utility)

### The Implication:
Going solar BEFORE a rate increase means you avoid that increase entirely. Your solar cost is fixed; utility rates keep climbing.

---

## Production by Season

Solar production varies throughout the year:

### California Monthly Production (Typical 8 kW System):

| Month | Production | % of Annual |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| January | 600 kWh | 5.5% |
| February | 700 kWh | 6.5% |
| March | 900 kWh | 8% |
| April | 1,000 kWh | 9% |
| May | 1,100 kWh | 10% |
| June | 1,150 kWh | 10.5% |
| July | 1,200 kWh | 11% |
| August | 1,150 kWh | 10.5% |
| September | 1,000 kWh | 9% |
| October | 850 kWh | 8% |
| November | 650 kWh | 6% |
| December | 550 kWh | 5% |

**Summer months produce more**, but your system generates valuable electricity year-round.

## Special Timing Considerations

### Planning for an EV?

If you're buying an electric vehicle:
- Size your solar system for EV charging NOW
- Or plan for easy expansion later
- Going solar before EV = immediate fuel savings

### Selling Your Home?

If you might sell in 2-3 years:
- Solar increases home value
- Systems installed > 2 years show history of savings
- Buyers prefer proven systems
- Consider timing relative to sale plans

### Roof Replacement Needed?

If your roof needs work within 5 years:
- Replace roof FIRST
- Or bundle roof + solar (some installers offer this)
- Don't install on a roof that needs replacement soon

---

## The Bottom Line on Timing

### Best Months to Sign:
1. **February-April:** Captures summer, smooth permitting
2. **September-October:** Faster processing, ready for next year
3. **Every other month:** Still great—just start

### Worst Strategy:
"Waiting for the perfect time" while paying utility bills every month.

### The Truth:
**There's no bad time to go solar in California.** Every month you wait is money paid to your utility. The best time is when you're ready.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Spring installation** captures full summer savings
- **Fall installation** means faster permits and smooth process
- **Winter installation** still makes sense—lower production is temporary
- **Waiting costs money**—5 months of delay = $1,000-2,000 in utility bills
- **Tax credit** applies in the year system activates
- **The best time is now**—perfect timing is less valuable than starting

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does solar production drop a lot in winter?
Yes, by about 40-50% compared to summer. But California winters are still sunny compared to most states. Your system produces meaningful power year-round.

### Can I install solar in December and get the tax credit?
Only if the system is operational (producing power) before December 31. If installation is complete but awaiting PTO, the credit applies to the following year.

### Will I save money if I install in winter?
Your first few months will have lower savings. But your first full summer will make up for it. The 25-year math is nearly identical regardless of start month.

### Is there a solar "season" with sales or discounts?
Some installers offer year-end promotions. But "sales" in solar are often marketing tactics. Get quotes anytime and compare—good pricing is available year-round.

### Should I wait for better technology?
No. Solar technology improves incrementally, and current panels are excellent. Waiting for "next generation" means paying utility bills now for marginal future improvements.

### What if permits take longer than expected?
This happens. A good installer manages expectations and keeps you informed. Permit delays don't change your contract terms or final price.
