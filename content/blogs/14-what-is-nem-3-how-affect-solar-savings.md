# What Is NEM 3.0 and How Does It Affect My Solar Savings?

**The short answer: NEM 3.0 is California's new net metering policy that reduced the value of excess solar energy you send back to the grid by 75-80%.** It took effect in April 2023 and fundamentally changed solar economics—but solar is still very much worth it. The key adaptation: battery storage is now essential for maximizing savings. Here's everything you need to know.

## What Is Net Energy Metering (NEM)?

Net Energy Metering is the system that governs how solar homeowners are credited for excess electricity they send to the grid.

### How It Works:

1. **Daytime:** Your solar panels produce electricity
2. **Self-consumption:** Power you use immediately has full value (avoided utility purchase)
3. **Excess production:** Extra power flows to the grid through your meter
4. **Credits:** The utility credits you for that exported power
5. **Evening/night:** You draw power from the grid
6. **True-up:** Credits offset your grid usage at the end of the billing cycle

The "net" in NEM means you pay the difference between what you consumed and what you produced.

## The Evolution: NEM 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0

### NEM 1.0 (Before 2016)
- **Export credit:** Full retail rate (same as you pay)
- **Example:** Export 1 kWh at 2 PM → Get credit worth 35¢
- **Status:** Closed to new customers

### NEM 2.0 (2016-April 2023)
- **Export credit:** Near-retail rate (retail minus ~2¢)
- **Example:** Export 1 kWh at 2 PM → Get credit worth ~33¢
- **Time-of-Use:** Exports during peak hours worth more
- **Status:** Closed to new customers April 2023

### NEM 3.0 / Net Billing Tariff (April 2023-Present)
- **Export credit:** Wholesale/avoided cost rates (5-8¢ average)
- **Example:** Export 1 kWh at 2 PM → Get credit worth ~5¢
- **Time-of-Use:** Still applies, but all values much lower
- **Status:** Current policy for new solar customers

## NEM 3.0 Export Values: The Real Numbers

Under NEM 3.0, export credits vary by:
- Time of day
- Month of year
- Your utility (PG&E, SCE, SDG&E)

### Typical NEM 3.0 Export Rates:

| Time Period | Export Credit | Retail Rate | Value Loss |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Morning (6 AM-4 PM) | 4-6¢ | 35-42¢ | ~85% |
| Peak (4-9 PM) | 6-10¢ | 50-65¢ | ~85% |
| Off-Peak (9 PM-6 AM) | 3-5¢ | 30-38¢ | ~88% |

**The pattern:** Export credits are roughly 15-20% of retail rates across all time periods.

### What This Means Practically:

**Under NEM 2.0:**
- Export 1 kWh at noon → ~35¢ credit
- Use 1 kWh from grid at 7 PM → Pay ~50¢
- Net cost: 15¢

**Under NEM 3.0:**
- Export 1 kWh at noon → ~5¢ credit
- Use 1 kWh from grid at 7 PM → Pay ~55¢
- Net cost: 50¢

Same electricity production. Dramatically different economics—unless you store that midday power instead of exporting it.

## Why California Made This Change

### The Utility Perspective:

1. **Grid costs don't go away:** When you export solar, utilities still maintain the grid, even if they pay you less for power.

2. **Solar saturation:** So much midday solar floods the grid that its wholesale value has dropped (the "duck curve").

3. **Cost shifting argument:** Utilities claimed non-solar customers subsidized solar customers' grid access.

### The Reality Check:

Critics argue NEM 3.0 went too far, making rooftop solar less attractive than utility-scale solar and slowing residential adoption. But the policy is now law and unlikely to change significantly.

## How NEM 3.0 Actually Affects Your Savings

Let's compare two scenarios for a home using 900 kWh/month:

### Scenario A: Solar Only (No Battery)

**System production:** 950 kWh/month
**Self-consumption:** 350 kWh (37%)
**Export to grid:** 600 kWh (63%)

**Monthly Economics:**
| Category | NEM 2.0 Value | NEM 3.0 Value |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Self-consumed savings | $147 | $147 |
| Export credits | $198 | $36 |
| Grid purchases (evening) | -$165 | -$165 |
| **Net monthly benefit** | **$180** | **$18** |

**NEM 3.0 impact without battery:** Savings reduced by 90%

### Scenario B: Solar + Battery

**System production:** 950 kWh/month
**Self-consumption:** 350 kWh (37%)
**Battery stored & used:** 450 kWh (47%)
**Export to grid:** 150 kWh (16%)

**Monthly Economics:**
| Category | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Self-consumed savings (direct) | $147 |
| Battery-shifted savings (peak hours) | $247 |
| Export credits | $9 |
| Grid purchases | -$55 |
| **Net monthly benefit** | **$348** |

**With battery:** Actually BETTER than NEM 2.0 for this household

## The Battery Imperative Under NEM 3.0

The math is clear: batteries transform NEM 3.0 from problematic to profitable.

### Why Batteries Change Everything:

| Strategy | Value per kWh |
|----------|---------------|
| Export to grid (NEM 3.0) | 5-8¢ |
| Store and use during peak | 50-65¢ |
| **Value difference** | **~10x** |

### How Battery Optimization Works:

**Morning (6 AM - 10 AM):**
- Solar production begins
- Power your home directly
- Begin charging battery

**Midday (10 AM - 4 PM):**
- Peak solar production
- Home uses solar
- Battery charges to 100%
- Any excess exports (low value, but unavoidable)

**Peak Hours (4 PM - 9 PM):**
- Solar production declining/ended
- Battery powers home
- Avoid 55-65¢/kWh grid purchases

**Night (9 PM - 6 AM):**
- Battery depleted
- Grid provides minimal needs (off-peak rates)

**Result:** 80-90% of your electricity never touches the grid at retail rates.

## NEM 3.0 Payback Periods: Real Numbers

With the shift to battery-focused systems, here's what payback looks like:

### Solar Only (Not Recommended Under NEM 3.0):

| Utility | Current Bill | Payback Period |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| SDG&E | $385/month | 9-11 years |
| PG&E | $315/month | 10-12 years |
| SCE | $294/month | 11-13 years |

### Solar + Battery (Recommended):

| Utility | Current Bill | Payback Period |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| SDG&E | $385/month | 5-6 years |
| PG&E | $315/month | 6-7 years |
| SCE | $294/month | 6-8 years |

**The battery investment pays for itself** through peak-rate avoidance.

## The 9-Year Lock-In Protection

One crucial NEM 3.0 provision: **your rate structure is locked in for 9 years** from the date you interconnect.

### What This Means:

- Your export rates won't decrease (even if policy changes)
- Your system design is optimized for current rules
- Future NEM 4.0 or policy changes won't affect you for 9 years

### After 9 Years:

You'll be transitioned to whatever policy exists then. But by that point:
- Your system will be largely paid off
- Technology will have evolved
- Battery costs will be even lower
- You can adapt your setup if needed

---

## Existing NEM 2.0 Customers: You're Protected

If you went solar before April 2023, you're grandfathered into NEM 2.0 for **20 years** from your interconnection date.

### Should NEM 2.0 Customers Add Batteries?

Maybe. Batteries still provide:
- Blackout protection
- Some peak-rate optimization
- Future-proofing for eventual NEM 2.0 expiration

But the economics are less urgent than for new NEM 3.0 customers.

## Common NEM 3.0 Myths

### Myth 1: "Solar doesn't make sense anymore"
**Reality:** Solar + battery systems have faster payback than solar-only systems did under NEM 2.0 in many cases. The economics shifted, not disappeared.

### Myth 2: "I should wait for NEM 3.0 to be repealed"
**Reality:** NEM 3.0 isn't going anywhere. It was heavily lobbied and is now settled policy. Waiting just means paying utility bills longer.

### Myth 3: "Batteries are too expensive"
**Reality:** Battery costs have dropped 80%+ in the past decade. With the 30% federal tax credit applying to batteries and SGIP rebates, net costs are very reasonable.

### Myth 4: "I should oversize my system to make up for low export credits"
**Reality:** The opposite. Size your system for self-consumption and let the battery capture excess. Oversizing just means exporting more at low rates.

## How to Design a System for NEM 3.0

### The Right Approach:

1. **Size solar for annual usage** (not more)
2. **Add enough battery** to store daily excess
3. **Minimize exports** through smart design
4. **Maximize self-consumption** with load shifting

### Typical NEM 3.0 Optimized System:

| Home Usage | Solar Size | Battery Size | Export % |
|------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| 600 kWh/mo | 5-6 kW | 10-13 kWh | 10-15% |
| 900 kWh/mo | 7-9 kW | 13-20 kWh | 10-15% |
| 1,200 kWh/mo | 10-12 kW | 20-27 kWh | 10-15% |

**Target:** Keep exports under 15% of production.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is solar still worth it under NEM 3.0?
Yes, but the system design matters more. Solar + battery is now the standard recommendation, and payback periods are still 5-7 years for most California homeowners.

### What if I can't afford a battery?
Solar-only can still make sense if your usage is very high (the self-consumption percentage will be higher). But the economics are significantly better with a battery.

### Can I add a battery later?
Yes, you can retrofit a battery to an existing solar system. However, it's typically 20-30% cheaper to install solar and battery together.

### How does NEM 3.0 affect my bill structure?
You'll receive monthly statements showing production, consumption, exports, and imports. Annual true-up still applies, but the math will be different than NEM 2.0.

### Do I still get credit for exports?
Yes, just at much lower rates (5-8¢ vs. 30-40¢). These credits accumulate and offset any grid power you purchase.

### What size battery do I need?
Generally, enough to store your expected excess production for use during peak hours. For most homes: 10-27 kWh (one to two Tesla Powerwalls or equivalent).
