# 5 Solar Myths Puerto Rico Homeowners Still Believe

**Misinformation about solar energy costs Puerto Rico families real money every month. From the belief that panels fail in cloudy weather to the assumption that everyone qualifies for the 30% federal tax credit, these five persistent solar myths keep homeowners tied to LUMA bills they do not have to pay. Here is the truth behind each one — backed by data, not sales pitches.**

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Solar panels produce electricity in cloudy and rainy conditions** — Puerto Rico receives 5-6 peak sun hours per day on average, and modern panels generate 10-25% of their rated output even under overcast skies.
- **Going solar in Puerto Rico can cost $0 upfront** through financing options, lease programs, and government-funded initiatives like PR-ERF and CDBG-MIT — and monthly solar payments are often lower than your current LUMA bill.
- **Properly installed solar panels protect your roof**, not damage it — but only when installed by trained, in-house crews who follow manufacturer specifications and local building codes.
- **Most Puerto Rico residents cannot claim the 30% federal solar tax credit** because they do not pay federal income tax — this is one of the most misunderstood facts in Puerto Rico solar, and it changes how you should evaluate financing.
- **Solar panels are engineered to survive hurricanes** — modern panels are rated for winds of 140-180 mph, and thousands of properly installed systems across Puerto Rico survived Hurricane Maria in 2017.

## Why Solar Myths Still Persist in Puerto Rico

Before we break down each myth individually, it is worth understanding why so much misinformation about solar energy persists on the island.

Puerto Rico sits at a unique intersection: high electricity costs, an unreliable grid, aggressive solar marketing, and a population that has been burned before — by PREPA, by LUMA, by contractors who disappeared after Hurricane Maria. That history creates justified skepticism. But skepticism without accurate information leads to paralysis, and paralysis keeps families paying $300, $400, or $500 per month to a utility company that cannot guarantee the lights will stay on.

The five myths below are not fringe beliefs. They are things we hear every single week from homeowners across the island — in Bayamon, Caguas, Carolina, Ponce, Mayaguez, and everywhere in between. Each one contains a grain of truth that has been stretched, distorted, or taken out of context. Let us set the record straight.

---

## Myth 1: "Solar Panels Don't Work in Cloudy or Rainy Weather"

### The Myth

This is probably the most common solar myth in Puerto Rico — and it makes intuitive sense on the surface. If solar panels need sunlight, what happens during the rainy season? What about those cloudy mornings in the mountains? If it rains for three days straight, does the whole system shut down?

The short answer: no. Not even close.

### The Reality

Solar panels do not need direct, blazing sunlight to generate electricity. They need light — and light passes through clouds. Modern photovoltaic panels generate electricity from both direct and diffuse (indirect) sunlight. On a cloudy day, a solar panel system will typically produce 10-25% of its rated capacity. On a partly cloudy day, that number jumps to 25-80%, depending on the cloud cover.

Here is the more important point: Puerto Rico is one of the best places in the United States for solar energy production, clouds and all. The island receives an average of 5 to 6 peak sun hours per day — significantly more than solar-heavy states like New York (3.5-4.5 hours), New Jersey (4-4.5 hours), and even parts of California.

To put this in perspective, Germany — a country that generates more solar power per capita than almost any nation on Earth — receives an average of 2.5-3.5 peak sun hours per day. If solar panels work profitably in Germany, they work exceptionally well in Puerto Rico.

### What About the Rainy Season?

Puerto Rico's rainy season runs roughly from April through November, with the heaviest rainfall typically from August through October. During this period, you will see more cloud cover and afternoon storms. But here is what matters: solar panels generate the majority of their electricity during the morning and early afternoon hours, before the typical Caribbean afternoon rain arrives. By the time the clouds roll in around 2 or 3 PM, your panels have already captured most of the day's energy.

And if you have a battery storage system — which we strongly recommend for every Puerto Rico installation — any excess energy generated during sunny morning hours is stored and available for use during cloudy afternoons, evenings, and overnight.

### The Bottom Line

Your solar panels will produce less electricity on a heavily overcast day. That is true. But over the course of a full year, Puerto Rico's solar resource is abundant enough to make solar one of the most cost-effective investments available to homeowners on the island. The rain does not cancel out your savings — it barely dents them.

## Myth 2: "I Can't Afford Solar"

### The Myth

This is the myth that costs Puerto Rico families the most money. The assumption goes like this: solar panels are expensive technology, installation costs thousands of dollars, and unless you have $15,000-$25,000 sitting in a savings account, solar is simply not an option.

A decade ago, there was some truth to this. Today, it is flat wrong.

### The Reality

Multiple pathways exist for Puerto Rico homeowners to go solar with zero upfront cost. Let us walk through the most common options.

#### $0-Down Solar Financing

Solar financing has evolved dramatically. Today, qualified homeowners can finance a complete solar panel and battery system with $0 down and fixed monthly payments that are often lower than their current LUMA electricity bill. Read that again: your monthly solar payment can be less than what you are already paying LUMA for unreliable power.

Here is a simplified comparison:

- **Average LUMA monthly bill in Puerto Rico:** $200-$400+ (depending on household size and consumption)
- **Typical monthly solar loan payment:** $120-$250 (depending on system size and loan terms)
- **Monthly savings from day one:** $50-$200+

You are not adding a cost to your budget. You are replacing a higher cost with a lower one — and at the end of the loan term, you own the system outright and your electricity cost drops to near zero.

#### Free Government Solar Programs

The Puerto Rico government, in partnership with federal agencies, has launched several programs that provide solar panel and battery systems to qualifying homeowners at no cost:

- **PR Energy Resilience Fund (PR-ERF):** Funded by FEMA, this program provides free solar and battery systems to eligible low- and moderate-income households.
- **CDBG-MIT (Community Development Block Grant - Mitigation):** Another federally funded program that provides free solar systems to qualifying Puerto Rico residents.

These programs have waitlists and lotteries, and not everyone qualifies. But they exist, they are real, and thousands of Puerto Rico families have already received free systems through them.

#### The Real Cost of Not Going Solar

Here is what many people overlook: the cost of staying with LUMA is not $0. You are paying — every single month — for electricity that is getting more expensive, not less. Puerto Rico electricity rates have risen significantly over the past five years, and the trend shows no sign of reversing. Every month you wait is another $200-$400 sent to LUMA that you will never get back.

Solar is not an expense. It is a replacement for an expense you already have — at a lower price, with a locked-in rate that does not increase.

At RIV Solar, we offer $0-down financing with a 25-year warranty, installed by our own in-house crews. No subcontractors, no surprises. If affordability is your concern, [contact us for a free consultation](https://rivsolar.com) — you may be surprised at what the numbers actually look like for your household.

## Myth 3: "Solar Panels Will Damage My Roof"

### The Myth

This fear comes from a reasonable place. You are drilling into your roof, mounting heavy equipment, and trusting that everything will stay watertight through years of tropical sun, rain, and hurricanes. If the installation is done poorly, yes — solar panels can cause roof leaks, structural damage, and voided warranties.

But the key phrase there is "done poorly."

### The Reality

A properly installed solar panel system does not damage your roof. In fact, it protects it. Here is how.

#### How Solar Panels Actually Protect Your Roof

Solar panels create a physical barrier between your roofing material and the elements. The area underneath the panels is shielded from direct UV radiation, heavy rain, and hail. Studies have shown that the roof surface beneath solar panels experiences significantly less wear and degradation over time compared to exposed sections of the same roof.

In Puerto Rico's harsh tropical climate — where UV exposure, salt air, and driving rain accelerate roof deterioration — that protective layer has real, measurable value.

#### The Installation Process Matters More Than the Panels

Roof damage from solar panels is almost always an installation problem, not an equipment problem. This is why who installs your system is arguably the most important decision you make when going solar.

Here is what a quality installation looks like:

- **Roof assessment before installation.** A qualified installer inspects your roof condition, material, age, and structural integrity before designing the system. If your roof needs repair or replacement, that should happen first.
- **Proper mounting and flashing.** Each mounting point is sealed with flashing (a waterproof barrier) that prevents leaks. The mounts are attached to the roof rafters — not just the plywood sheathing — ensuring structural strength.
- **Manufacturer-specified torque and spacing.** Every bolt is tightened to the exact specification required by the mounting system manufacturer. Over-tightening cracks tiles or compromises seals. Under-tightening allows movement.
- **Code-compliant engineering.** The entire system must meet local building codes and wind load requirements, which in Puerto Rico are significantly more stringent than on the mainland due to hurricane exposure.

#### Why In-House Crews Matter

Here is where many Puerto Rico homeowners get burned: a solar company sells the system, then subcontracts the installation to a third-party crew. That crew may be juggling multiple jobs, using unfamiliar equipment, or cutting corners to finish quickly. When a leak appears six months later, the solar company points at the installer, the installer points at the solar company, and the homeowner is stuck with the bill.

RIV Solar does not subcontract installations. Our crews are in-house, trained, and supervised by our own team. Every installation is done according to manufacturer specifications and Puerto Rico building codes. And our 25-year warranty covers the entire system — panels, inverters, batteries, and the mounting hardware on your roof.

If your roof is in good condition before installation, it will be in better condition after — because the panels are now protecting it.

## Myth 4: "Everyone in Puerto Rico Gets the 30% Federal Tax Credit"

### The Myth

This is the most dangerous myth on this list because it directly affects the financial math that homeowners use to decide whether solar is worth it. The myth goes like this: the federal government offers a 30% tax credit for residential solar installations, so every Puerto Rico homeowner can knock 30% off the cost of their system.

Solar salespeople — including some who should know better — repeat this claim constantly. It sounds great. But for the vast majority of Puerto Rico residents, it is not true.

### The Reality

The 30% federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is a credit against federal income tax liability. Here is the critical fact that changes everything for Puerto Rico:

**Most Puerto Rico residents do not pay federal income tax.**

Under Section 933 of the Internal Revenue Code, income earned in Puerto Rico by bona fide residents is generally excluded from U.S. federal income tax. This means that if all or most of your income comes from sources within Puerto Rico, you likely have little to no federal income tax liability — and therefore no federal tax against which to apply the 30% credit.

#### Who CAN Claim It?

There are specific groups of Puerto Rico residents who may be able to claim the federal solar tax credit:

- **Federal government employees** stationed in Puerto Rico (military, postal workers, federal agency staff) who pay federal income tax on their salaries.
- **Individuals with significant income from U.S. mainland sources** — for example, rental income from properties on the mainland, mainland-based investments, or mainland-based businesses.
- **Certain retirees** receiving pensions or Social Security income that is subject to federal taxation.

If you fall into one of these categories, you may be able to use the ITC. But you should confirm with a qualified tax professional before making any financial decisions based on that assumption.

#### What Puerto Rico Incentives ARE Available?

Even without the federal tax credit, Puerto Rico offers significant solar incentives that reduce the effective cost of your system:

- **100% sales tax exemption** on solar equipment and installation (Act 83, formerly Act 114).
- **100% property tax exemption** on any increase in home value attributable to your solar system.
- **Net metering** through LUMA Energy, which allows you to earn credits for excess electricity your system sends to the grid (extended through at least 2031).

These incentives are real, available to all Puerto Rico residents, and do not require federal income tax liability.

#### Why This Myth Is Dangerous

When a solar salesperson tells you that your $25,000 system will "really only cost $17,500 after the tax credit," and you later discover that you cannot claim that credit, you are stuck with a system that cost $7,500 more than you budgeted for. This is how trust in the entire solar industry erodes — and why we believe transparency about this issue is not optional.

At RIV Solar, we walk every customer through the real financial picture for their specific situation. If you qualify for the federal tax credit, great — we will help you document it. If you do not, we will show you the actual numbers and structure a financing plan that works without it. No bait-and-switch.

## Myth 5: "Solar Panels Won't Survive a Hurricane"

### The Myth

After Hurricane Maria destroyed much of Puerto Rico's infrastructure in September 2017, it is completely understandable that homeowners question whether solar panels can survive a major hurricane. The visual memory of shattered buildings, stripped roofs, and downed power lines makes the idea of mounting expensive equipment on your roof feel reckless.

But here is what the data actually shows.

### The Reality

Modern solar panels are engineered to withstand extreme weather conditions, including hurricanes. Here are the facts.

#### Wind Rating Standards

Solar panels sold in the U.S. market must meet UL (Underwriters Laboratories) standards for durability. Most tier-one solar panels are rated to withstand wind speeds of 140 mph, and many premium panels carry ratings of up to 180 mph.

For reference:

- **Hurricane Maria** made landfall in Puerto Rico as a high-end Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 155 mph and gusts exceeding 200 mph.
- **Category 4 hurricanes** carry sustained winds of 130-156 mph.
- **Category 5 hurricanes** carry sustained winds of 157+ mph.

A 140-180 mph wind rating means that properly installed solar panels can survive the vast majority of hurricanes — including most Category 4 storms.

#### What Happened During Maria?

Here is the fact that many Puerto Rico homeowners do not know: thousands of solar panel systems survived Hurricane Maria. While the island's electrical grid was completely destroyed — taking months and in some cases nearly a year to restore — many homes with properly installed solar and battery systems had electricity within days or even hours after the storm passed.

The panels that failed during Maria typically shared common factors:

- **Improper installation.** Panels mounted without proper engineering, inadequate mounting hardware, or insufficient attachment to the roof structure.
- **Substandard equipment.** Low-quality panels and mounting systems that did not meet UL wind rating standards.
- **Pre-existing roof damage.** Panels installed on roofs that were already compromised, leading to the entire roof failing — not just the solar equipment.

#### What Makes a Hurricane-Resistant Installation?

The difference between a solar system that survives a hurricane and one that does not comes down to installation quality:

1. **Engineered mounting systems** designed for Puerto Rico's wind zone requirements, which are more stringent than most mainland installations.
2. **Through-bolt attachment** to roof rafters or structural members, not just surface-mounted.
3. **Proper panel spacing** that allows wind to pass over and around the array, reducing uplift forces.
4. **Code-compliant design** that accounts for local wind load requirements based on the specific location on the island.
5. **Quality equipment** from manufacturers whose panels carry verified UL ratings of 140 mph or higher.

#### Battery Storage Adds Resilience

Even if a hurricane knocks out the LUMA grid for weeks — as Maria did — a solar-plus-battery system can continue generating and storing electricity as soon as the sun returns. If your panels survive the storm (and properly installed panels are designed to do exactly that), you have a self-sustaining power source while the rest of the island waits for grid restoration.

During Maria, homeowners with solar and battery systems became community resources — charging neighbors' phones, running refrigerators for shared food storage, and powering medical equipment that had no other source.

RIV Solar installs all systems to Puerto Rico's hurricane-zone building codes, using tier-one panels rated for 140-180 mph winds and mounting systems engineered for extreme weather. Our 25-year warranty means that if something does fail, we stand behind it.

## How to Separate Solar Facts From Fiction

With so much conflicting information circulating about solar energy in Puerto Rico, here are some practical guidelines for evaluating claims you hear from salespeople, neighbors, or social media:

### Ask for Documentation

Any legitimate claim about solar panel performance, wind ratings, or financial savings should be backed by documentation. Ask for spec sheets, engineering certifications, and written financial projections. If a salesperson cannot provide them, that is a red flag.

### Verify Tax Credit Eligibility With a CPA

Do not take a solar salesperson's word on whether you qualify for the federal tax credit. Speak to a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or tax professional who understands Puerto Rico's unique tax relationship with the federal government.

### Check the Installer's Track Record

Ask how long the company has been installing in Puerto Rico, whether they use in-house crews or subcontractors, and what their warranty covers. Ask for references from previous customers in your area.

### Get Multiple Quotes

Never sign with the first company that knocks on your door. Get at least two or three quotes from different installers and compare not just price, but equipment quality, warranty terms, installation practices, and financing conditions.

### Be Skeptical of "Too Good to Be True"

If someone tells you that solar is completely free with no strings attached, or that your system will pay for itself in one year, or that you are guaranteed the federal tax credit — slow down. Those claims are either misleading or outright false.

## Is Solar Worth It in Puerto Rico? The Honest Answer

After debunking these five solar myths in Puerto Rico, here is the straightforward answer: yes, solar is worth it for the vast majority of Puerto Rico homeowners. But the reasons it is worth it are not the exaggerated claims you hear from aggressive salespeople. The real reasons are practical:

1. **You are already paying for electricity** — solar replaces that cost with a lower one.
2. **The grid is unreliable** — solar with battery backup gives you energy independence.
3. **Electricity rates are rising** — solar locks in your cost for 25 years.
4. **The equipment is proven** — modern panels and batteries are durable, efficient, and warrantied.
5. **Real incentives exist** — even without the federal tax credit, Puerto Rico's sales tax exemption, property tax exemption, and net metering make solar financially compelling.

The key is going in with accurate information, realistic expectations, and a trustworthy installer who will tell you the truth — even when the truth is more complicated than a sales pitch.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do solar panels work during Puerto Rico's rainy season?

Yes. Solar panels generate electricity from both direct and indirect sunlight. During Puerto Rico's rainy season, your system will produce less electricity on heavily overcast days — typically 10-25% of rated capacity — but the overall annual solar production remains strong because the island receives 5-6 peak sun hours daily on average. A battery system stores excess energy from sunny hours for use during cloudy periods.

### Can I really go solar in Puerto Rico with no money down?

Yes. Multiple $0-down financing options are available to qualified Puerto Rico homeowners, with monthly payments that are often lower than current LUMA electricity bills. Additionally, government programs like PR-ERF and CDBG-MIT provide free solar and battery systems to eligible low- and moderate-income households, though these programs operate on waitlists and lotteries.

### Do most Puerto Rico homeowners qualify for the 30% federal solar tax credit?

No. Most Puerto Rico residents do not pay federal income tax on income earned on the island, which means they have no federal tax liability against which to apply the 30% Investment Tax Credit. Federal employees, individuals with mainland-sourced income, and certain retirees may qualify. Consult a CPA to determine your specific eligibility.

### Can solar panels survive a Category 4 hurricane?

Modern tier-one solar panels are rated to withstand winds of 140-180 mph. Category 4 hurricanes carry sustained winds of 130-156 mph. Thousands of properly installed solar systems in Puerto Rico survived Hurricane Maria, a high-end Category 4 storm. The key factor is proper installation by experienced crews using code-compliant mounting systems designed for Puerto Rico's wind zone requirements.

### Will solar panels damage my roof in Puerto Rico?

No — when installed correctly, solar panels actually protect your roof by shielding it from direct UV radiation, heavy rain, and debris. Roof damage from solar installations is almost always the result of poor installation practices: improper mounting, inadequate flashing, or attaching to weak structural points. Choosing an installer that uses in-house crews and follows manufacturer specifications eliminates this risk.
