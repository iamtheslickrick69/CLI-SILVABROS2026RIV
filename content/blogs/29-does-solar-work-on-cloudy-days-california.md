# Does Solar Work on Cloudy Days in California?

**The short answer: Yes, solar panels work on cloudy days—just at reduced output.** Depending on cloud cover, panels produce 10-50% of their full-sun capacity. California averages 260-300 sunny days per year, so cloudy days have minimal impact on annual production. Your system is designed to account for weather variations. Here's what you need to know.

## How Solar Panels Work on Cloudy Days

### The Science:

Solar panels convert **light** into electricity—not just direct sunlight. Even on cloudy days:
- Diffuse light penetrates clouds
- UV rays reach panels (clouds block less UV than visible light)
- Panels still generate electricity

### Production Levels by Weather:

| Condition | Production vs. Full Sun |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Clear, sunny | 100% |
| Partly cloudy | 50-80% |
| Overcast | 25-50% |
| Heavy clouds/rain | 10-25% |
| Very dark storm | 5-10% |

Your panels never fully stop—they just produce less.

## California's Weather Advantage

### Why Cloudy Days Don't Matter Much:

California is one of the sunniest states in the US:

| Region | Sunny Days/Year | Cloudy Days/Year |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Inland Empire | 280-290 | 75-85 |
| San Diego | 265-275 | 90-100 |
| Central Valley | 265-275 | 90-100 |
| Bay Area | 250-260 | 105-115 |
| US Average | 205 | 160 |

Even California's "cloudiest" areas get more sun than most of the country.

### Monthly Cloud Patterns:

| Month | Typical Conditions | Production |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| January | Some rain, cool | Lowest month |
| February | Variable | Low |
| March | Transitional | Moderate |
| April | Clearing | Good |
| May | Mostly clear | Very good |
| June | Marine layer morning | Excellent |
| July | Clear, hot | Peak |
| August | Clear, hot | Peak |
| September | Clear | Excellent |
| October | Clear | Very good |
| November | Variable | Moderate |
| December | Some rain | Low |

**Summer months carry the production**—and that's when you need power most for AC.

## Real Production Data: Cloudy vs. Sunny Days

### Example: 8 kW System in Riverside

**Sunny July day (clear, 95°F):**
- Peak output: 7.2 kW
- Daily production: 45 kWh
- Value at 45¢/kWh: $20.25

**Cloudy January day (overcast):**
- Peak output: 2.5 kW
- Daily production: 12 kWh
- Value at 45¢/kWh: $5.40

**Difference:** 73% less production on the cloudy day

**But remember:** You have 280+ sunny days to balance out the cloudy ones.

### Annual Impact:

If you had NO cloudy days, you might produce 5% more annually. But:
- Systems are designed for your actual climate
- Quotes account for historical weather
- Your savings estimates include cloudy days

## The "June Gloom" Factor

Southern California experiences "marine layer" in late spring/early summer:
- Morning fog and clouds
- Burns off by midday
- Can persist into early afternoon

### Impact on Solar:

| Hour | Condition | Production |
|------|-----------|------------|
| 7-10 AM | Marine layer | 20-40% |
| 10 AM-12 PM | Clearing | 60-80% |
| 12-5 PM | Clear | 100% |
| 5-7 PM | Clear | 60-80% |

**Result:** You lose some morning production but peak afternoon is unaffected. Net impact: 10-15% lower production on June Gloom days.

---

## Winter vs. Summer Production

### Why Winter Produces Less:

1. **Shorter days:** 10 hours of daylight vs. 14 in summer
2. **Lower sun angle:** Sun is lower in sky, less direct
3. **More clouds:** California's rainy season is winter
4. **Less AC usage:** You also need less power

### Seasonal Production Difference:

| Month | Typical kWh (8 kW system) | % of Annual |
|-------|--------------------------|-------------|
| January | 600 | 5.5% |
| June | 1,150 | 10.5% |
| July | 1,200 | 11% |
| December | 550 | 5% |

**Summer months produce 2x winter months**—but summer is when you use (and save) the most.

---

## What About Rainy Days?

### Production During Rain:

Light rain: 15-25% of normal
Heavy rain: 5-15% of normal
Thunderstorm: 5-10% of normal

### Silver Lining:

Rain cleans your panels naturally:
- Removes dust and debris
- Restores production efficiency
- Saves you from manual cleaning

After a rainy period, panels often produce slightly BETTER than before (cleaner surfaces).

---

## How Your System Is Designed

### Accounting for Weather:

Professional solar designers use:
- **Historical irradiance data** (actual sun measurements for your area)
- **Weather pattern analysis** (typical cloud cover by month)
- **Location-specific factors** (microclimates, coastal vs. inland)

Your production estimate already includes cloudy days. What you're quoted is what you can expect.

### Oversizing Not Needed:

Some people ask: "Should I add extra panels for cloudy days?"

Answer: Not necessary. Your system is sized for:
- Your annual electricity usage
- Your location's actual solar resource
- Realistic production expectations

Adding panels "for clouds" would overproduce on sunny days, wasting money under NEM 3.0.

## Comparison: California vs. Other States

### Why California Solar Works Better:

| State | Solar Resource | Cloudy Days | Avg. Production |
|-------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **California** | Excellent | ~80-100 | ~1,500 kWh/kW |
| Arizona | Excellent | ~60-80 | ~1,600 kWh/kW |
| Texas | Good | ~100-120 | ~1,400 kWh/kW |
| Florida | Good | ~120-140 | ~1,350 kWh/kW |
| New York | Fair | ~160-180 | ~1,150 kWh/kW |
| Washington | Fair | ~200-220 | ~1,050 kWh/kW |

Even cloudy Washington has a thriving solar industry. California's concerns about clouds are minimal by comparison.

## Do Panel Types Matter for Cloudy Days?

### Some perform slightly better:

**Monocrystalline panels:**
- Best overall efficiency
- Good performance in low light
- Industry standard

**Heterojunction (HJT) panels:**
- Slightly better low-light performance
- Premium price
- Worth it for frequently cloudy areas

**Thin-film panels:**
- Actually best in low light
- But much lower overall efficiency
- Rarely used for residential

### Practical Impact:

The difference between panel types in cloudy conditions is 2-5%—meaningful for commercial installations, marginal for residential.

## Battery Storage and Cloudy Days

### How Batteries Help:

**Sunny days:** Solar produces excess → Charges battery
**Cloudy days:** Solar produces less → Battery supplements

With a properly sized battery:
- Store sunny-day excess for cloudy-day use
- Maintain consistent home power regardless of weather
- Less grid dependence

### Sizing Consideration:

If your area has frequent cloudy periods:
- Slightly larger battery captures more sunny-day excess
- Better coverage during extended cloudy weather
- More energy independence

- **California averages 260-300 sunny days**—far above national average
- **Your system quote accounts for weather**—it's already factored in
- **Summer production is 2x winter**—aligns with your higher summer usage

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do solar panels work at night?
No. Panels need light to produce electricity. At night, you draw from battery (if you have one) or the grid.

### What about fog?
Similar to clouds—diffuse light still reaches panels. Production is reduced but not zero. Coastal fog typically burns off by midday.

### Will one cloudy week ruin my savings?
No. Solar savings are calculated annually. One cloudy week is balanced by sunny weeks. Your bill evens out over the year (especially with TOU and annual true-up).

### Should I clean panels after cloudy/rainy weather?
No—rain usually cleans them. Wait for sunny weather to see if production normalizes. If you're in a dusty area, occasional cleaning helps after the rainy season ends.

### Do clouds affect battery charging?
Yes. On very cloudy days, solar may not fully charge your battery. However, most systems are sized so sunny days charge the battery sufficiently for occasional cloudy periods.

### Is solar worth it in Northern California where it's cloudier?
Absolutely. The Bay Area and Northern California still have excellent solar resources—much better than many states with thriving solar industries.
