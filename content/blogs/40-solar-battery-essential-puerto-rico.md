# Solar + Battery: Essential for Puerto Rico Homeowners

**In most of the mainland US, battery storage is optional. In Puerto Rico, it's essential.** Between LUMA's unreliable grid, frequent outages, and hurricane season, solar without battery leaves you vulnerable exactly when you need power most.

Here's why battery storage is non-negotiable for Puerto Rico solar.

## Why Battery Is Essential in PR

### The LUMA Reality

| Grid Issue | Frequency |
|------------|-----------|
| Unplanned outages | Weekly in many areas |
| Planned maintenance outages | Regular |
| Voltage fluctuations | Common |
| Extended outages (days) | After storms |
| Island-wide blackouts | Multiple since 2021 |

### What Happens Without Battery

When LUMA's grid fails, solar panels without battery **automatically shut off**. This is a safety requirement — your system can't send power to lines that workers might be repairing.

**Result:** During an outage, your solar panels sit idle while you're in the dark. All that sunshine wasted.

### What Happens With Battery

When the grid fails with battery storage:

1. System detects outage instantly
2. Automatic transfer switch activates
3. Battery powers essential loads
4. Solar recharges battery during day
5. You have power while neighbors don't

## The Hurricane Factor

Hurricane Maria proved what happens when the grid fails catastrophically:

| Impact | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| Initial blackout | Entire island |
| 50% power restored | 3 months |
| 90% power restored | 8 months |
| 100% power restored | 11 months |

During those months, homes with solar + battery:
- Kept refrigerators running (food safety)
- Powered medical equipment (life safety)
- Had lights at night (security)
- Charged phones (communication)
- Ran fans (comfort in tropical heat)

## Choosing the Right Battery

### Battery Options for Puerto Rico

| Battery | Capacity | Best For |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Tesla Powerwall 3 | 13.5 kWh | Whole-home backup |
| Enphase IQ 5P | 5 kWh (stackable) | Modular, expandable |
| Franklin aPower | 13.6 kWh | Outdoor installation |
| SolarEdge Home Battery | 10 kWh | SolarEdge systems |

### Sizing Your Battery

| Home Size | Daily Usage | Recommended Battery |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Small (1-2 BR) | 15-20 kWh | 10-15 kWh |
| Medium (3-4 BR) | 25-35 kWh | 20-30 kWh |
| Large (5+ BR) | 40-50 kWh | 30-40 kWh |

**For Puerto Rico, we recommend sizing for 24-48 hours of essential loads** to cover typical outage durations.

## What Battery Can Power

### Essential Loads (24-48+ hours runtime)

| Load | Power Draw | Daily Usage |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Refrigerator | 150W | 3.6 kWh |
| LED lights (10) | 100W | 1 kWh |
| Phone charging | 25W | 0.5 kWh |
| WiFi router | 10W | 0.24 kWh |
| Fans (2) | 100W | 2.4 kWh |
| **Total** | **385W** | **7.7 kWh** |

With a 13.5 kWh battery, this provides ~42 hours of backup — **before** solar recharging.

### Extended Loads (reduced runtime)

Adding these reduces backup duration:

| Load | Power Draw | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| Window AC | 1,200W | Significant |
| Well pump | 750W | Moderate |
| Microwave | 1,000W | Short bursts OK |
| Washing machine | 500W | Moderate |

### What to Avoid During Outages

- Central AC (too much draw)
- Electric water heater (too much draw)
- Pool pump (non-essential)
- Electric stove (use propane backup)

## Battery Economics in Puerto Rico

### Cost Breakdown

| Item | Cost | After 30% Credit |
|------|------|------------------|
| Tesla Powerwall 3 | $15,000 | $10,500 |
| Enphase IQ 5P (×2) | $11,200 | $7,840 |
| Franklin aPower | $16,000 | $11,200 |

### Value Proposition

Battery value in Puerto Rico comes from:

1. **Outage protection:** Priceless for food safety, medical needs
2. **Peace of mind:** No anxiety during storms or grid failures
3. **Energy arbitrage:** Store cheap solar, use during peak (if TOU rates implemented)
4. **Extended system life:** Reduces cycling stress on solar

### ROI Calculation

While battery ROI is harder to calculate than solar, consider:

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Avoided generator fuel | $500-1,000/year |
| Avoided food spoilage | $200-500/event |
| Medical equipment protection | Priceless |
| Property value increase | 3-5% |
| Peace of mind | Priceless |

## Solar + Battery System Design

### Optimal Configuration for PR

| Component | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Solar array | 120-130% of annual usage |
| Battery capacity | 24-48 hours essential loads |
| Inverter | Hybrid (solar + battery integrated) |
| Transfer switch | Automatic, whole-home |
| Monitoring | App-based, real-time |

### Critical Loads Panel

We install a **critical loads panel** that automatically receives battery power during outages:

**Connected to critical panel:**
- Refrigerator circuit
- Master bedroom outlets
- Kitchen outlets (partial)
- Medical equipment outlets
- Network equipment

**Not on critical panel:**
- AC compressor
- Electric water heater
- Pool equipment
- Non-essential outlets

## Battery Maintenance in Tropical Climate

### Puerto Rico Considerations

| Factor | Our Approach |
|--------|--------------|
| Heat | Batteries in shaded/ventilated location |
| Humidity | Indoor or weather-rated outdoor units |
| Salt air | Corrosion-resistant enclosures |
| Hurricanes | Protected mounting, surge protection |

### Ongoing Maintenance

Modern batteries are virtually maintenance-free:

- No user maintenance required
- Automatic firmware updates
- Self-monitoring and alerts
- 10-15 year warranties typical

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long will battery last during an outage?

Depends on your usage and battery size. A 13.5 kWh battery powering essential loads typically lasts 24-48 hours — and solar recharges it each day.

### Can I add battery to existing solar?

Yes! We retrofit batteries to existing systems regularly. Requires assessment of current inverter compatibility.

### Do I need a generator too?

Battery eliminates the need for a generator in most cases. For extended outages (week+), a small propane generator can supplement.

### What if there's no sun for days?

Battery provides 1-2 days backup. Even on cloudy days, solar produces 10-25% of normal, extending battery life. For week-long cloudy periods (rare in PR), a generator backup is wise.

### Does battery work during a hurricane?

Battery provides power during the storm. If panels are intact afterward, system resumes normal operation immediately.

## The Bottom Line

In Puerto Rico, solar without battery is an incomplete solution:

| Scenario | Solar Only | Solar + Battery |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Normal day | Works great | Works great |
| Grid outage (day) | **No power** | Full power |
| Grid outage (night) | **No power** | Battery power |
| Hurricane aftermath | **No power for days/weeks** | Power restored next sunny day |
| LUMA bill | Reduced 60-80% | Reduced 60-80% |

For the additional investment of $8,000-12,000 (after tax credit), battery provides:

- **Energy security** during outages
- **Hurricane resilience** when the grid fails
- **Independence** from LUMA's unreliability
- **Peace of mind** you can't put a price on

In Puerto Rico, battery isn't an upgrade — it's essential.
