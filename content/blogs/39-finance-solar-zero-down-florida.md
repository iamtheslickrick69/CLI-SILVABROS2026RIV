# How to Finance Solar Panels in Florida With $0 Down

**You do not need cash upfront to go solar in Florida. Between solar loans, leases, power purchase agreements (PPAs), PACE financing, and SELF loans, multiple $0 down pathways exist — and the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) can dramatically reduce what you actually owe, often making your monthly solar payment lower than your current electric bill.**

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Several $0 down options are available in Florida** — solar loans, leases, PPAs, PACE programs, and SELF nonprofit loans each work differently and suit different financial situations.
- **Solar loans let you own your system from day one**, which means you keep the 30% federal tax credit and build equity in your home.
- **PACE financing requires no credit check** and repays through your property tax bill, making it accessible to homeowners who may not qualify for traditional loans.
- **Monthly solar payments frequently cost less than FPL or Duke Energy bills**, especially once the federal tax credit is factored in.
- **Florida's sales tax and property tax exemptions** further reduce the total cost of going solar, regardless of which financing path you choose.

## Yes, $0 Down Solar in Florida Is Real

If you have been putting off solar because you assumed it required a large upfront investment, it is time to revisit that assumption. The solar financing landscape in Florida has matured considerably. Today, most homeowners who install solar panels pay nothing out of pocket on day one.

Here is why that is possible:

- **Competitive lending markets.** Banks, credit unions, and specialty solar lenders compete aggressively for Florida customers, driving down interest rates and eliminating down-payment requirements.
- **Federal incentives.** The 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) reduces the net cost of a solar system by nearly a third, which lenders factor into their loan structures.
- **State-level exemptions.** Florida exempts solar equipment from sales tax and excludes the added value from property tax assessments, meaning the true cost of ownership is lower than the sticker price.

The result: a homeowner paying $180 per month to FPL or Duke Energy can often switch to a solar payment of $120 to $160 — and eventually pay nothing at all once the system is paid off.

Let us walk through every financing option available to you.

## Solar Loans: Own Your System From Day One

A solar loan works like any other home improvement loan. You borrow the cost of the system, make monthly payments over a fixed term, and own the panels outright from the moment they are installed.

### How Solar Loans Work

1. A lender provides the funds to cover the full system cost (typically $18,000 to $35,000 before incentives for a Florida home).
2. You make fixed monthly payments over 10, 15, 20, or 25 years.
3. Because you own the system, **you claim the 30% federal ITC** on your personal tax return.
4. Many borrowers use the ITC refund to pay down the principal, which lowers monthly payments or shortens the loan term.

### Why Solar Loans Are Popular in Florida

- **Ownership = maximum savings.** Over 25 years, owning your system typically saves $30,000 to $60,000 compared to staying on grid power.
- **Home equity.** Studies show solar panels increase a Florida home's resale value by 3% to 4%.
- **Predictable payments.** Fixed-rate loans protect you from utility rate hikes, which have averaged 3% to 5% annually in Florida.

### What to Know Before Signing

- Check whether the loan has a **dealer fee** baked in. Some solar loans advertise low interest rates but include a 15% to 30% dealer fee rolled into the principal. Ask for the total cost of the loan, not just the rate.
- Confirm whether the rate is **fixed or variable**. Fixed rates provide certainty; variable rates may start lower but can increase.

At RIV Solar, we walk every customer through the total loan cost — principal, interest, fees, and net savings — before you sign anything. Transparency is not optional for us; it is how we operate.

## Solar Leases: Panels on Your Roof, No Ownership

A solar lease lets you use a solar system installed on your roof in exchange for a fixed monthly payment. The leasing company owns the panels, maintains them, and insures them.

### How Solar Leases Work

- A third-party company installs, owns, and maintains the system.
- You pay a fixed monthly lease payment, typically $80 to $150.
- The lease term usually runs 20 to 25 years.
- At the end of the term, you can buy the system, renew the lease, or have the panels removed.

### Pros

- No maintenance responsibility.
- Predictable monthly cost.
- No credit score requirements in some programs.

### Cons

- **You do not own the system**, so you cannot claim the 30% ITC.
- Total lifetime savings are significantly lower than with a loan.
- Leases can complicate home sales — the buyer must agree to assume the lease or you must buy it out.

Solar leases made more sense a decade ago when system costs were much higher. Today, with prices continuing to fall and strong tax incentives available, most Florida homeowners benefit more from ownership through a loan.

---

## Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs): Pay for the Electricity, Not the Panels

A PPA is similar to a lease but instead of paying a fixed monthly fee for the equipment, you pay a per-kilowatt-hour rate for the electricity the panels produce.

### How PPAs Work

- A third party installs and owns the system on your roof.
- You buy the electricity it generates at a set rate, typically lower than your utility rate.
- The rate may include a small annual escalator (1% to 3%).

### Pros

- Immediate savings on your electric bill.
- No maintenance costs.
- No upfront payment.

### Cons

- You do not own the system or claim the ITC.
- The annual escalator can erode savings over time.
- PPA availability in Florida varies — not all providers offer them statewide.

PPAs can be a reasonable option if you do not qualify for a loan, but for most Florida homeowners, a $0 down solar loan delivers better long-term value.

## PACE Financing: Repay Through Your Property Tax Bill

Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing is a unique option that ties repayment to your property tax bill rather than to your personal credit.

### How PACE Works

1. A PACE provider funds your solar installation.
2. Repayment is added as a special assessment on your annual property tax bill.
3. The assessment stays with the property — if you sell your home, the new owner assumes the remaining payments.
4. Terms typically run 15 to 25 years.

### Why PACE Stands Out

- **No credit score requirement.** Approval is based on property equity and payment history, not your FICO score.
- **Transferable on sale.** The obligation passes to the next homeowner, which can simplify things if you plan to move.
- **Covers the full cost.** PACE can finance 100% of the system, including installation.

### What to Watch For

- PACE interest rates tend to be **higher than solar loan rates** — sometimes 6% to 9%.
- Because PACE creates a property tax lien, it takes priority over your mortgage. Some mortgage lenders are uncomfortable with this, so check with your lender before signing.
- Not all Florida counties participate in PACE programs. Most of South Florida, Central Florida, and the Tampa Bay area are covered, but confirm availability for your address.

## SELF Loans: Florida's Nonprofit Solar Lender

The Solar and Energy Loan Fund (SELF) is a nonprofit Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) based in Florida. It was created specifically to make clean energy accessible to underserved communities.

### How SELF Works

- SELF provides loans for solar panels, energy efficiency upgrades, and storm hardening.
- Loan amounts typically range from $5,000 to $50,000.
- Terms extend up to 15 to 20 years.
- Interest rates are competitive, and there are **no prepayment penalties**.

### Who SELF Is Designed For

- Homeowners with **moderate or lower credit scores** who may not qualify for conventional solar loans.
- Low-to-moderate income households.
- Homeowners in underserved or rural Florida communities.

### Why It Matters

SELF fills a critical gap. If your credit score is below 650 or your income makes conventional lenders hesitant, SELF may still approve you. Because it is a nonprofit, its mission is access — not maximizing shareholder returns.

## How the 30% Federal Tax Credit Affects Your Financing

The 30% Investment Tax Credit is the single most important incentive in the solar equation, and it directly impacts your financing math.

### Example

- **System cost:** $28,000
- **30% ITC value:** $8,400
- **Net cost after ITC:** $19,600

If you finance $28,000 with a solar loan, your initial monthly payment is based on the full amount. But once you receive your ITC refund (applied to your federal tax return the following year), you can use that $8,400 to:

- **Pay down the principal**, reducing your monthly payment going forward.
- **Shorten the loan term**, getting to $0 monthly payments faster.
- **Pocket the savings** if your current monthly payment is already comfortable.

This is a major advantage of ownership-based financing (loans, PACE, SELF) over leases and PPAs. When a leasing company owns the panels, **they** claim the ITC — not you.

### ITC Eligibility Reminders

- You must owe enough federal income tax to use the credit. If your tax liability is less than $8,400, you can carry the unused portion forward to future tax years.
- The system must be installed on your primary or secondary residence (not a rental property you do not live in).
- The ITC is currently set at 30% through 2032, stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034.

At RIV Solar, we help you estimate your ITC value during the proposal process so there are no surprises come tax season.

## What to Watch For When Financing Solar in Florida

Not all solar financing is created equal. Here are the most common pitfalls:

### 1. Hidden Dealer Fees

Some solar companies advertise a 1.99% interest rate but embed a 25% dealer fee into the loan. On a $28,000 system, that is $7,000 added to your balance. Always ask: **"What is the total amount financed, including all fees?"**

### 2. Escalator Clauses in PPAs

A 2.9% annual escalator on a PPA may sound small, but over 20 years your per-kWh rate could nearly double. Run the numbers for year 10 and year 20 before signing.

### 3. Unrealistic Production Estimates

If a company promises your system will eliminate 100% of your electric bill, ask for the production model and the assumptions behind it. Overpromising leads to disappointing savings.

### 4. Pressure Tactics

Any company that pressures you to sign today or claims a deal expires tonight is not acting in your interest. Legitimate solar financing offers do not evaporate overnight.

### 5. Ignoring Roof Condition

Financing solar on a roof that needs replacement in five years is a costly mistake. A reputable installer will assess your roof's condition and remaining lifespan before recommending an installation.

RIV Solar uses in-house crews — not subcontractors — and we inspect every roof before proposing a system. If your roof needs work first, we will tell you directly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is $0 down solar financing legitimate in Florida?

Yes. Multiple financing structures — solar loans, leases, PPAs, PACE, and SELF — allow Florida homeowners to install solar panels with no upfront cost. These are established financial products offered by banks, credit unions, specialty lenders, and government-backed programs.

### Which $0 down option gives me the best long-term savings?

A solar loan typically delivers the highest lifetime savings because you own the system and claim the 30% federal tax credit. Over 25 years, loan-financed solar owners in Florida often save $30,000 to $60,000 compared to staying on utility power.

### Can I get solar financing in Florida with bad credit?

Yes. PACE financing has no credit score requirement — approval is based on your property equity and tax payment history. SELF, a Florida-based nonprofit lender, also works with homeowners who have credit scores below the thresholds set by conventional lenders.

### Does the 30% federal tax credit apply to financed systems?

The 30% ITC applies to any solar system you own, regardless of whether you paid cash or financed it with a loan. It does not apply if you lease the system or use a PPA, because in those cases the leasing company owns the panels and claims the credit.

### Will solar financing affect my ability to sell my home?

It depends on the financing type. Solar loans are paid off at closing like any other lien. PACE assessments transfer to the new owner. Leases and PPAs require the buyer to assume the agreement or for you to buy out the contract. In all cases, homes with solar panels typically sell faster and at a premium in Florida.
