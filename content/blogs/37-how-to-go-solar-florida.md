# How to Go Solar in Florida: Step-by-Step Guide

**Going solar in Florida involves eight key steps: assessing your energy usage, evaluating your roof, understanding state and federal incentives like the 30% tax credit, choosing a qualified installer, designing your system, completing installation, passing inspection, and connecting to the grid. Most Florida homeowners complete the process in 6 to 12 weeks.**

## Key Takeaways

- **Florida offers some of the best solar economics in the nation** thanks to abundant sunshine, a 30% federal tax credit, full retail net metering, and sales and property tax exemptions on solar equipment.
- **Your roof condition, orientation, and shading** directly determine system size and savings potential --- get a professional assessment before signing anything.
- **Choosing a licensed, experienced installer** with in-house crews (not subcontractors) protects your investment and simplifies warranty claims for the next 25 years.
- **The entire process from consultation to powering on takes 6 to 12 weeks**, with actual roof work typically completed in one to three days.
- **Florida's Solar Rights Act prevents HOAs from blocking solar installations**, so no homeowner in the state can be denied the right to generate their own clean energy.

## Why Florida Is One of the Best States for Solar

Florida is not called the Sunshine State for nothing. With an average of 230 sunny days per year and some of the highest solar irradiance levels in the country, Florida homeowners are uniquely positioned to benefit from solar energy. But strong sunlight is only part of the equation.

The state pairs that natural advantage with favorable policies: no sales tax on solar equipment, no increase to property taxes when you add panels, full retail net metering from most utilities, and access to the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit. The result is a payback period that often falls between 7 and 10 years, with 25-plus years of near-free electricity after that.

If you have been thinking about making the switch, this guide walks you through every stage of the solar installation process in Florida --- from your first electricity bill review to the moment your system starts generating power.

---

## Step 1: Assess Your Energy Needs and Electricity Bills

The foundation of any good solar project is understanding how much energy your household actually uses. Before you request quotes or start browsing panel specs, gather the following:

### Pull 12 Months of Utility Data

Log into your utility account (FPL, Duke Energy, Tampa Electric, or JEA) and download your last 12 months of electricity bills. You are looking for:

- **Total annual kilowatt-hour (kWh) consumption** --- this tells installers what size system to design.
- **Monthly usage patterns** --- Florida homes typically spike in summer due to air conditioning, which affects how solar offsets your costs.
- **Your current rate per kWh** --- most Florida utilities charge between $0.12 and $0.15 per kWh, and rates have risen steadily over the past decade.

### Calculate Your Solar Offset Goal

Most homeowners aim to offset 80% to 100% of their electricity usage. A typical Florida home consuming 1,200 kWh per month would need a system in the 8 to 10 kW range, though your specific number depends on roof orientation, shading, and panel efficiency.

## Step 2: Evaluate Your Roof

Your roof is the platform your solar investment sits on for the next 25 to 30 years, so its condition matters enormously.

### Roof Age and Condition

If your roof is more than 15 years old or showing signs of wear --- cracked tiles, missing shingles, soft spots --- consider replacing it before or during solar installation. Adding panels to a roof that needs replacement within five years means you will pay to remove and reinstall them later.

### Orientation and Pitch

In Florida, south-facing roofs capture the most sunlight, but west-facing and even east-facing surfaces still perform well given the state's latitude and sun angles. The ideal roof pitch falls between 15 and 30 degrees, though flat roofs work too with tilted racking systems.

### Shading Analysis

Tall trees, neighboring buildings, and even chimneys can reduce panel output significantly. A professional installer will use satellite imagery, drone surveys, or on-site shade analysis tools to map your roof's solar access hour by hour throughout the year.

### Hurricane Considerations

Florida's building codes are among the strictest in the country for wind resistance. Any solar installation must meet the Florida Building Code requirements for high-velocity wind zones. Quality racking systems are rated for winds exceeding 160 mph, and properly installed panels can actually help protect your roof during storms by adding a layer of impact resistance.

---

## Step 3: Understand Florida Solar Incentives and Savings

One of the biggest advantages of going solar in Florida is the stack of financial incentives available to homeowners.

### Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) --- 30%

The federal government offers a dollar-for-dollar tax credit equal to 30% of your total solar installation cost, including battery storage if you add it. On a $30,000 system, that is a $9,000 reduction on your federal tax liability. This credit is available through at least 2032.

### Florida Sales Tax Exemption

Solar energy systems are 100% exempt from Florida's 6% state sales tax. On a $30,000 system, that saves you $1,800 compared to states without this exemption.

### Property Tax Exemption

Florida excludes the added value of a solar energy system from your property tax assessment. So while solar increases your home's market value by an average of 4%, you will not pay a penny more in property taxes.

### Net Metering

Florida requires investor-owned utilities (FPL, Duke Energy, Tampa Electric) to offer full retail net metering. When your panels produce more electricity than you use during the day, that excess flows back to the grid and your meter literally spins backward. You receive a credit at the full retail rate, which offsets your nighttime and cloudy-day usage.

### PACE and SELF Financing

Florida offers Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) and Solar Energy Loan Fund (SELF) programs that allow you to finance solar with no money down and repay through your property tax bill or a low-interest loan. These programs are especially helpful for homeowners who may not qualify for traditional financing.

## Step 4: Choose the Right Solar Installer

This is arguably the most consequential decision in the entire process. The installer you choose determines the quality of your system, the reliability of your warranty, and your experience for the next two to three decades.

### What to Look For

- **Florida licensing** --- Your installer must hold a valid Florida Electrical Contractor (EC) or Solar Contractor (CV) license. Verify it on the [DBPR website](https://www.myfloridalicense.com).
- **In-house installation crews** --- Companies that subcontract their labor have less control over quality. In-house teams are trained, consistent, and accountable.
- **Strong warranty coverage** --- Look for at least a 25-year warranty on panels and workmanship. Make sure the company backs the warranty directly, not through a third party.
- **Transparent pricing** --- A reputable installer will provide itemized quotes, explain every line item, and never pressure you into signing the same day.
- **Local reputation** --- Check Google reviews, BBB ratings, and ask for references from recent installations in your county.

### Red Flags to Avoid

- Door-to-door salespeople pushing "limited-time" deals
- Companies that refuse to provide written quotes before you sign
- Installers who cannot show proof of Florida licensing
- Quotes that seem dramatically lower than competitors (often signals inferior equipment or hidden costs)

## Step 5: System Design and Permits

Once you have selected your installer, the design and engineering phase begins.

### Custom System Design

Your installer's engineering team will design a system tailored to your roof geometry, energy usage, and savings goals. This includes:

- **Panel layout** --- maximizing production while maintaining aesthetic appeal and code compliance.
- **Inverter selection** --- string inverters, microinverters, or power optimizers, each with trade-offs in cost, efficiency, and monitoring capability.
- **Battery storage (optional)** --- adding a home battery like the Tesla Powerwall or Enphase IQ Battery provides backup power during outages and can maximize your net metering benefits.

### Permitting

Florida requires building permits for all solar installations. Your installer handles this process, which involves submitting engineered plans to your local building department. Permitting timelines vary by county:

- **South Florida (Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach):** 2 to 4 weeks
- **Central Florida (Orange, Hillsborough, Duval):** 1 to 3 weeks
- **North Florida and rural counties:** 1 to 2 weeks

### HOA Notification

If you live in a community with a homeowners association, Florida's Solar Rights Act (Section 163.04, Florida Statutes) prohibits your HOA from preventing you from installing solar panels. They may request certain aesthetic considerations, but they cannot deny your application or impose conditions that significantly increase cost or reduce performance.

---

## Step 6: Installation Day --- What to Expect

This is the part most homeowners are surprised by: actual installation is fast.

### Timeline

A typical residential solar installation in Florida takes **one to three days** of on-roof work. Larger systems or those with battery storage may take an additional day.

### What Happens

1. **Racking installation** --- The crew mounts aluminum rails to your roof rafters using engineered attachment points. In Florida, these mounts must meet wind-load requirements specific to your county's wind zone.
2. **Panel mounting** --- Solar panels are secured to the racking system and wired together in series or parallel strings.
3. **Inverter and electrical work** --- The inverter is installed (typically near your main electrical panel), and all wiring is connected to your home's electrical system.
4. **Battery installation (if applicable)** --- Home batteries are mounted on a garage wall or exterior surface and integrated with the inverter system.

### What You Need to Do

Honestly, not much. Make sure your installer has clear access to your roof, electrical panel, and attic if needed. You do not need to be home for the entire installation, but most homeowners like to check in at least once.

---

## Step 7: Inspection and Utility Connection

Your system is installed, but you cannot flip the switch just yet.

### Building Inspection

Your local building department will send an inspector to verify that the installation meets Florida Building Code and National Electrical Code requirements. This inspection is typically scheduled within one to two weeks of installation.

### Utility Interconnection

After passing inspection, your installer submits an interconnection application to your utility company. This requests permission to connect your solar system to the grid and activates your net metering agreement. Timelines vary:

- **FPL:** Typically 1 to 2 weeks after inspection
- **Duke Energy Florida:** 2 to 3 weeks
- **Tampa Electric (TECO):** 1 to 3 weeks

### Permission to Operate (PTO)

Once the utility approves your interconnection, you receive "Permission to Operate." This is the green light to turn your system on and start generating solar electricity. Your installer will walk you through system activation, monitoring setup, and what to expect on your first solar-powered utility bill.

## Step 8: Monitor Your System and Enjoy the Savings

Congratulations --- your solar panels are now producing clean, free electricity from Florida sunshine.

### Monitoring

Modern solar systems include real-time monitoring apps that show you exactly how much energy your panels are producing, how much your home is consuming, and how much you are exporting to the grid. Check your app regularly for the first few months to establish a baseline, and set up alerts for any performance drops.

### Maintenance

Solar panels in Florida require very little maintenance. Rain handles most cleaning naturally. We recommend:

- **Annual visual inspection** of panels, racking, and wiring
- **Trimming any new tree growth** that creates shading
- **Checking your monitoring app** for production anomalies that might indicate a panel or inverter issue

### Long-Term Savings

A well-designed solar system in Florida typically saves homeowners $30,000 to $60,000 over its 25-year lifespan, depending on system size, utility rates, and rate inflation. With electricity costs rising an average of 3% to 4% per year, your savings actually increase over time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does it cost to go solar in Florida?

The average residential solar installation in Florida costs between $20,000 and $35,000 before incentives. After the 30% federal tax credit, most homeowners pay $14,000 to $24,500. With $0-down financing options, many Florida homeowners go solar with no upfront cost and monthly payments lower than their current electricity bill.

### How long do solar panels last in Florida?

Modern solar panels are designed to last 25 to 30 years or more, even in Florida's heat and humidity. Most manufacturers guarantee at least 80% production capacity at the 25-year mark. Quality panels installed with hurricane-rated racking systems are engineered to withstand Category 5 wind speeds.

### Can my HOA prevent me from installing solar panels in Florida?

No. Florida's Solar Rights Act (Section 163.04, Florida Statutes) explicitly prohibits HOAs from banning or unreasonably restricting solar installations. Your HOA may request reasonable aesthetic accommodations, but they cannot deny your right to install solar panels or impose conditions that significantly increase cost or decrease system performance.

### Is Florida net metering going away?

As of 2025, Florida's full retail net metering policy remains in effect for all investor-owned utilities, including FPL, Duke Energy, and Tampa Electric. While legislative proposals have surfaced, the current policy continues to protect solar homeowners. Systems installed under the current rules are typically grandfathered for 20 years.

### Do solar panels work during hurricanes and power outages?

Standard grid-tied solar systems automatically shut off during power outages for safety reasons --- this protects utility workers repairing lines. However, if you pair your panels with a home battery system, you can maintain power to essential circuits during outages. Given Florida's hurricane season, battery backup is an increasingly popular addition for solar homeowners.
