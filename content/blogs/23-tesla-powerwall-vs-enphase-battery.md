Automatically charges to 100% when severe weather is forecast, ensuring maximum backup when you need it.

**4. Tesla Ecosystem**
Works seamlessly with Tesla Solar, Tesla EVs, and the Tesla app. Virtual Power Plant participation available.

**5. Whole-Home Backup**
One Powerwall can back up most homes. Two provide extended backup with AC running.

### Weaknesses:

**1. Shorter Warranty**
10 years vs. Enphase's 15 years. However, real-world Powerwalls are lasting well.

**2. Larger Single Investment**
$12,000-$15,000 at once vs. Enphase's smaller incremental units.

**3. Tesla Dependency**
Some frustration with Tesla customer service and delivery timelines.

**4. All-or-Nothing**
If the unit fails, you lose all backup capacity until repaired.

Industry-leading warranty provides long-term peace of mind.

**2. Modularity**
Start with one unit (5 kWh), add more anytime up to 80 kWh total.

**3. Redundancy**
If one unit fails, others continue working. No total system failure.

**4. Excellent Monitoring**
Enphase Enlighten app provides detailed production, consumption, and battery data.

**5. Microinverter Compatibility**
Pairs seamlessly with Enphase microinverters for panel-level optimization.

**6. Smaller Units**
Easier to install in tight spaces. 99 lbs vs. 287 lbs.

### Weaknesses:

**1. Lower Power Per Unit**
3.84 kW continuous per unit. Need 2-3 units to match Powerwall's power output.

**2. Higher Cost at Scale**
For equivalent capacity (15 kWh), Enphase costs slightly more.

**3. More Complex Installation**
Multiple units mean more connections, more potential failure points.

**4. No Storm Watch**
Lacks Tesla's automatic weather-based charging (though you can manually set to 100%).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I mix Tesla and Enphase?
Not recommended. Each requires its own management system. Choose one platform for simplicity.

### Which has better app/monitoring?
Both have excellent apps. Tesla's is slightly simpler; Enphase's provides more detail. Personal preference.

### Which lasts longer?
Both are relatively new, so long-term data is limited. Enphase's 15-year warranty suggests confidence in longevity.

### Can I expand a Powerwall system?
Yes. You can add Powerwalls later (up to 4), though it's more expensive than installing together.

### Which is better for NEM 3.0?
Both work equally well for peak-shifting under NEM 3.0. The battery chemistry/management is similar.

### What do installers prefer?
Varies by installer certification. Tesla-certified installers prefer Powerwall; Enphase-certified prefer Enphase. Ask your installer about their experience.
