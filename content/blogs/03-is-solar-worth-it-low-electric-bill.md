# Is Solar Worth It If I Have a Low Electric Bill?

**The short answer: It depends on how low.** If your bill is under $75/month, solar probably doesn't make financial sense right now. Between $75-150/month, it's borderline—worth exploring. Over $150/month, solar almost always pays off in California.

> **Quick Summary:** The break-even point in California is roughly $100-125/month. Below that, payback periods stretch beyond 10 years. But consider this: your "low" bill today probably won't stay low. EVs, work-from-home, and rate increases change the equation fast.

## What Counts as "Low" in California?

What's considered a "low" electric bill depends on where you live. California's rates are so high that our "low" bills would be average elsewhere:

| Bill Amount | California Context | National Context |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Under $75 | Very low | Low |
| $75-125 | Low | Average |
| $125-175 | Below average | Above average |
| $175-250 | Average | High |
| $250+ | Above average | Very high |

**The California reality:** A $150/month bill means you're using less electricity than most of your neighbors. That's great for your wallet today—but it changes the solar calculation.

### California Average Bills (2026):

| Utility | Average Monthly Bill | Average kWh Usage |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| SDG&E | $385 | 700 kWh |
| PG&E | $315 | 700 kWh |
| SCE | $294 | 700 kWh |

If you're at $150/month, you're using roughly half the average—around 350 kWh.

## Real Stories: Low-Bill Homeowners Who Evaluated Solar

**Linda M. — Redlands, CA (SCE) — $95/month bill**
> "I met with three solar companies. Two tried to sell me anyway. The third—the one I eventually used—told me honestly that at my usage, the payback would be 9-10 years. But then they asked about my plans. I was buying an EV. Suddenly my projected bill was $220/month. I went solar sized for the EV, and now I'm saving $150/month."

**Tom & Barbara S. — Hemet, CA (SCE) — $85/month bill**
> "We're retired, home is paid off, and we're careful with electricity. Solar didn't make sense for us purely on the numbers—12-year payback. But we're in a PSPS zone and lost power for 3 days last October. We got solar + battery for peace of mind. The savings are a bonus."

**Marcus D. — Fontana, CA (SCE) — $110/month bill**
> "My bill was low because I was never home—traveling for work constantly. Then COVID hit, I started working from home, and suddenly I was at $180/month. Should have gone solar when my bill was low and sized for work-from-home."

## The Break-Even Math for Low-Usage Homes

Let's do real calculations for different bill levels:

### $75/Month Bill:

| Factor | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Annual utility cost | $900 |
| System size needed | ~2.5 kW |
| Gross system cost | $8,750 |
| After 30% tax credit | $6,125 |
| Annual savings | ~$850 (some utility connection fees remain) |
| **Payback period** | **7.2 years** |
| 25-year savings | ~$18,000 |

**Verdict:** Borderline. Makes sense if you're staying long-term, but savings are modest.

### $100/Month Bill:

| Factor | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Annual utility cost | $1,200 |
| System size needed | ~3.5 kW |
| Gross system cost | $12,250 |
| After 30% tax credit | $8,575 |
| Annual savings | ~$1,140 |
| **Payback period** | **7.5 years** |
| 25-year savings | ~$25,000 |

**Verdict:** Starting to make sense. Reasonable payback with decent lifetime savings.

### $125/Month Bill:

| Factor | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Annual utility cost | $1,500 |
| System size needed | ~4.5 kW |
| Gross system cost | $15,750 |
| After 30% tax credit | $11,025 |
| Annual savings | ~$1,440 |
| **Payback period** | **7.7 years** |
| 25-year savings | ~$32,000 |

**Verdict:** Solid investment. Good payback period with meaningful savings.

### $150/Month Bill:

| Factor | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Annual utility cost | $1,800 |
| System size needed | ~5.5 kW |
| Gross system cost | $19,250 |
| After 30% tax credit | $13,475 |
| Annual savings | ~$1,740 |
| **Payback period** | **7.7 years** |
| 25-year savings | ~$40,000 |

**Verdict:** Strong candidate. This is where solar clearly makes sense.

## The Hidden Factor: Why Your Bill Won't Stay Low

Here's what most "low bill" homeowners don't consider: **your usage patterns will likely change.**

### Electric Vehicles Are Coming

California mandates all new cars be electric by 2035. Even if you're not buying an EV tomorrow, you probably will eventually.

**EV charging impact on your bill:**

| Driving Amount | Added kWh/Month | Added Cost (SCE) |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Light (8,000 miles/year) | 200 kWh | $84/month |
| Average (12,000 miles/year) | 300 kWh | $126/month |
| Heavy (18,000 miles/year) | 450 kWh | $189/month |

**Your $100 bill becomes $225+ with an EV.** Suddenly solar economics look very different.

### Work-From-Home Reality

If you transitioned to remote or hybrid work:

| Change | Added Monthly Cost |
|--------|-------------------|
| Home office (computer, lights, climate) | $30-50 |
| Full-time WFH | $50-75 |
| WFH + summer AC during day | $100-150 |

**Your $100 bill becomes $150-250 with WFH.** Many homeowners saw this during COVID and the trend continues.

### Life Changes

| Change | Bill Impact |
|--------|-------------|
| Kids move back home | +$50-100/month |
| Aging parents move in | +$40-80/month |
| Pool pump added | +$75-150/month |
| Hot tub | +$80-120/month |
| Medical equipment | +$30-100/month |
| Home addition/ADU | +$100-200/month |

**The question isn't "What's my bill today?"—it's "What will my bill be in 3-5 years?"**

## When Low-Bill Solar DOES Make Sense

### Scenario 1: You're Planning an EV Purchase

**Sarah K. — Riverside, CA**

| Current | After EV |
|---------|----------|
| $90/month SCE bill | $215/month SCE bill |
| "Solar doesn't make sense" | "Why didn't I go solar sooner?" |

**Smart approach:** Go solar now, sized for current usage + EV. You'll "oversize" for a few months, then your EV arrives and the system is perfectly matched.

### Scenario 2: You Want Blackout Protection

If you're in a PSPS-affected area (common in foothills and fire-prone regions of Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego counties), battery backup has value beyond bill savings.

**Value calculation:**

| Factor | Estimated Value |
|--------|-----------------|
| Avoiding food spoilage per outage | $200-400 |
| Avoiding hotel stay per multi-day outage | $150-300/night |
| Peace of mind (medical equipment users) | Priceless |
| Keeping home security active | Security |

A solar + battery system for a low-usage home might cost $18,000-22,000 net. If it prevents two multi-day outage disasters over 25 years, it's paid for itself beyond the electricity savings.

### Scenario 3: You're Environmentally Motivated

The financial case for solar is strongest with high bills—but that's not the only consideration.

**Environmental impact of a small 4 kW system:**
- Offsets 4-5 tons of CO2 annually
- Equivalent to driving 10,000 fewer miles per year
- Powers your home with clean energy for 30+ years

If environmental impact matters to you, solar can make sense even when the pure financial case is borderline.

### Scenario 4: You're Retiring and Planning Ahead

**Jim & Carol T. — Sun City, CA (SCE) — $105/month bill**
> "Our bill is low because we're gone half the year. But we're stopping the travel—too old for it. Once we're home year-round with the AC running, our summer bills will triple. We went solar now while we had the income to get the full tax credit."

---

## When Low-Bill Solar Doesn't Make Sense

### Your Bill Is Under $75 AND:
- You're not adding an EV
- You're not changing your lifestyle
- You might move within 5 years
- You rent (can't install anyway)

### You're on CARE/FERA Assistance AND:
- Your income is unlikely to change
- Rates are already discounted 30-35%
- You can't use the tax credit

### Your Roof Is Problematic AND:
- Heavy shading
- Needs replacement within 5 years
- Unusual structure

---

## Alternative Options for Low-Usage Homes

### Option 1: Smaller System Now, Expand Later

Install a small system (3-4 kW) that matches your current usage. When you add an EV or your usage increases, add more panels.

**Downside:** Expansion costs more per watt than initial installation. But it reduces upfront investment.

### Option 2: Battery-Only for Backup

If your primary goal is blackout protection, not bill savings, you could install a battery system without solar. Charge from the grid during off-peak hours, use during outages.

**Downside:** No bill savings, no energy independence. But lower cost than full solar + battery.

### Option 3: Wait and Monitor

If you're genuinely uncertain, wait 12 months. But actively track:
- Your utility bills (are they rising?)
- Your lifestyle (any changes coming?)
- Your EV plans

Set a trigger: "If my average bill exceeds $X, I'll get solar quotes."

### Option 4: Community Solar

Some utilities offer community solar programs where you subscribe to a shared solar project and receive credits on your bill.

**Downside:** Lower savings than rooftop solar (typically 5-15% discount), no backup power, no home value increase.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the minimum electric bill for solar to make sense?
In California, the practical threshold is around $100-125/month for a reasonable payback period. Below that, payback extends beyond 10 years, which may not fit your timeline.

### Can I install a smaller solar system to match my low usage?
Absolutely. Systems are custom-designed based on your actual usage. A 3-4 kW system for a low-usage home costs less than an 8-10 kW system for high-usage homes.

### Will my low bill stay low forever?
Almost certainly not. California rates increase 7-9% annually. A $100 bill today becomes $150 in 5 years and $200+ in 10 years. The question isn't IF your bill will rise, but WHEN.

### Should I wait until my bill is higher before going solar?
It depends on your timeline. If you'll stay in the home 15+ years, locking in now—even with modest savings—beats paying ever-increasing rates. If you're moving in 5 years, waiting might make sense.

### Does the 30% tax credit still apply to small systems?
Yes. The federal Investment Tax Credit applies to systems of any size. A $10,000 system gets $3,000 back; a $30,000 system gets $9,000 back. Same percentage regardless of size.

### What if I add an EV later?
Your solar system can often be expanded with additional panels. Or, if you anticipate an EV, size your initial system for future usage. It's usually cheaper to install a larger system upfront than to expand later.
