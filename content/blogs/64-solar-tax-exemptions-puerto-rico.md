# What Are Solar Tax Exemptions in Puerto Rico? Complete Breakdown

**Puerto Rico offers several solar tax exemptions that can dramatically reduce the cost of going solar. These include a 100% property tax exemption on the value solar adds to your home, a sales and use tax exemption on solar equipment, and — for qualifying residents — access to the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit. Together, these incentives make Puerto Rico one of the most solar-friendly jurisdictions in the U.S.**

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Property tax exemption:** Solar energy systems in Puerto Rico are 100% exempt from property taxes for 25 years under the Green Energy Incentives Act, meaning your home value increases without raising your tax bill.
- **Sales tax exemption:** All solar equipment — panels, inverters, batteries, racking — is currently exempt from Puerto Rico's sales and use tax (IVU), though this exemption faces an ongoing legislative challenge.
- **Federal ITC limitations:** Most Puerto Rico residents cannot claim the 30% federal solar tax credit because they do not pay federal income tax. Only those with U.S.-sourced income who file a federal return may qualify.
- **Free solar programs exist but are limited:** Government-funded programs like PR-ERF and CDBG-MIT offer free or heavily subsidized solar systems, but applications are largely waitlisted.
- **Net metering is protected through 2031**, giving solar homeowners a reliable way to offset electricity costs with the energy they send back to the grid.

## What Solar Tax Exemptions Does Puerto Rico Offer?

If you have been researching solar tax exemptions in Puerto Rico, you have probably noticed the information out there can be confusing — especially when it comes to what applies on the island versus the mainland U.S.

Here is the straightforward version. Puerto Rico has its own set of solar incentives that exist separately from (and in some cases instead of) federal programs. The main tax exemptions available to homeowners going solar in Puerto Rico include:

1. **100% property tax exemption** on the added value solar brings to your home
2. **Sales and use tax (IVU) exemption** on solar panels, inverters, batteries, and related equipment
3. **The federal 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC)** — but only for residents who qualify based on their income source
4. **Green Energy Tax Exemption** benefits under Puerto Rico law for businesses and commercial-scale operations

Beyond tax exemptions, there are also government-funded programs that provide free or subsidized solar installations, plus net metering protections that let you earn credit for the energy you send back to the grid.

Let's break each one down so you know exactly what you are eligible for and what steps to take.

## 100% Property Tax Exemption for Solar Energy Systems

This is one of the most valuable Puerto Rico solar incentives available to homeowners — and one of the most overlooked.

### What It Covers

When you install a solar energy system on your home in Puerto Rico, the added value that system brings to your property is **completely exempt from property taxes**. Your home becomes more valuable, but your property tax bill does not go up because of it.

This exemption was established under the **Green Energy Incentives Act (Act 83-2010)**, later incorporated into the Puerto Rico Incentives Code (Act 60-2019). It applies to residential, commercial, and agricultural properties using qualifying renewable energy systems including photovoltaic panels, battery storage, and solar water heaters.

### How Long Does the Exemption Last?

The property tax exemption lasts for **25 years** from the date of installation — essentially the full useful lifespan of a modern solar energy system, and the length of the warranty RIV Solar provides on every installation.

### Why This Matters

A typical residential solar system in Puerto Rico can add $15,000 to $30,000 or more in value to a home. Without this exemption, that increase would be reflected in your annual property tax assessment. With it, you get the full value boost — better equity, higher resale price — without paying a cent more in property taxes. No special certificate or separate approval process is required beyond your standard solar installation permitting.

---

## Sales and Use Tax (IVU) Exemption on Solar Equipment

Puerto Rico's combined sales and use tax (known as the IVU) is among the highest in U.S. jurisdictions. The exemption from this tax on solar equipment is a significant cost saver.

### What Equipment Is Exempt?

Under **Section 4030.17 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code**, the following solar equipment is exempt from the sales and use tax:

- Solar panels (photovoltaic modules)
- Inverters (string and micro-inverters)
- Battery storage systems
- Racking and mounting hardware
- Associated accessories and components used to generate electrical energy

This means when you purchase a solar system for your home, the equipment itself carries no IVU. For a system that might cost $20,000 or more, avoiding the tax translates to real savings — potentially $2,000 or more depending on system size.

### An Important Legislative Update

Transparency matters, so here is something you should know: in 2025, Governor Jenniffer Gonzalez introduced a tax reform package that included a proposal to **repeal the solar equipment sales tax exemption**. The proposal drew significant opposition from solar advocates, industry groups, and even Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz.

As of early 2026, the exemption remains active and in effect. However, the legislative debate is ongoing, and the future of this particular incentive depends on the outcome of the broader tax reform process. If you have been considering solar and want to lock in this benefit, now is a good time to move forward before any potential changes take effect.

## The Federal Solar Tax Credit (ITC) — Who Actually Qualifies in Puerto Rico?

This is where things get tricky, and where a lot of misinformation circulates. Let's set the record straight on solar tax credits in Puerto Rico.

### The Key Rule Most People Miss

The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) allows you to claim **30% of the total cost** of a solar energy system — including panels, batteries, labor, and permitting — as a dollar-for-dollar credit on your federal income tax return. For systems installed between 2022 and 2032, the credit rate is 30%.

Here is the catch: **most Puerto Rico residents do not pay federal income tax.** If you live and work in Puerto Rico and all of your income is Puerto Rico-sourced, you do not file a federal income tax return — which means you have no federal tax liability to apply the credit against. The IRS defines "United States" for purposes of the residential energy credit as the 50 states and D.C. — not U.S. territories.

### Who Can Claim the 30% Federal ITC in Puerto Rico?

You may still be able to claim the federal solar tax credit if you have **U.S.-sourced income** — meaning income earned from activities, employment, or investments in the 50 states or D.C. — and you file a federal tax return (Form 1040).

Examples of people in Puerto Rico who may qualify include:

- Federal government employees stationed in Puerto Rico
- Military personnel
- Remote workers employed by mainland U.S. companies who receive W-2 income
- Residents with significant investment income from U.S.-based sources
- Business owners with mainland operations

### Our Honest Recommendation

**Do not assume you qualify for the federal ITC.** Before making any financial decisions based on it, consult with a **Puerto Rico-licensed CPA** who understands both local and federal tax law. A qualified tax professional can review your specific income sources and tell you definitively whether you can claim the credit.

At RIV Solar, we never build a customer's savings estimate around the federal ITC unless we know they qualify. That is part of our commitment to transparent, honest pricing — no hidden surprises after installation.

## Free Solar Programs in Puerto Rico

Beyond tax exemptions, Puerto Rico has several government-funded programs designed to bring solar energy to residents at no cost. These are separate from tax incentives and are worth understanding even if you end up going a different route.

### Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund (PR-ERF)

The **PR-ERF** is a federally funded program managed through the U.S. Department of Energy, launched in 2023 to install solar-plus-storage systems for households across the island — particularly low-to-moderate income families and communities with unreliable grid access.

**Current status:** As of early 2026, the DOE announced a reallocation of up to $350 million from distributed rooftop solar toward grid infrastructure projects, creating uncertainty about future residential installations under the program.

### CDBG-MIT Solar Programs

The **Community Development Block Grant — Mitigation (CDBG-MIT)** program, administered by the Puerto Rico Department of Housing (Vivienda), includes several solar-focused initiatives:

- **CEWRI Program:** Covers up to 100% of costs (up to $40,000 per household)
- **New Energy Program:** Covers 100% of costs (up to $30,000) for residents earning under 80% of the area median income
- **Solar Incentive Program:** Covers 30% of installation costs (up to $15,000)

**Current status:** Most of these programs are **heavily waitlisted**. General application windows have largely closed, though installations continue for approved applicants.

### What This Means for You

If you qualify for a free solar program, take advantage of it — the savings are hard to beat. But if you are waitlisted or the timeline is unclear, you do not have to wait. The combination of Puerto Rico's tax exemptions, net metering benefits, and RIV Solar's **$0-down financing** options means you can start saving on electricity immediately without depending on government program timelines.

## Net Metering — Another Key Solar Benefit

While not technically a tax exemption, net metering is one of the most important Puerto Rico solar incentives and directly affects your return on investment.

Under Puerto Rico's net metering policy, when your solar panels produce more electricity than your home uses, the excess energy is sent back to the LUMA Energy grid. You receive a **credit on your electric bill** for that exported energy, which offsets the cost of electricity you draw from the grid at night or on cloudy days.

**The good news:** Puerto Rico's net metering protections were strengthened in 2024 under **Act 10**, which prevents the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau from modifying net metering rules until at least **2031**. This gives solar homeowners long-term certainty that their investment will continue to pay off.

With electricity rates in Puerto Rico among the highest in any U.S. jurisdiction — often exceeding $0.25 to $0.30 per kWh — the value of net metering credits adds up fast.

## How to Claim Solar Tax Exemptions in Puerto Rico

Here is a step-by-step overview of what claiming each exemption looks like in practice:

### Property Tax Exemption

- **Action required:** Generally automatic. The value added by your solar system should not be assessed as additional taxable property value under the Green Energy Incentives Act.
- **Documentation to keep:** Your installation contract, invoices, equipment specifications, and interconnection agreement with LUMA Energy. Keep these records for the full 25-year exemption period.

### Sales Tax Exemption

- **Action required:** Your solar installer should already price your system without the IVU on qualifying equipment. If you see sales tax charged on solar panels, inverters, batteries, or racking, ask about the exemption.
- **Tip:** Work with an established installer like RIV Solar that understands Puerto Rico tax law and applies the exemption correctly from the start.

### Federal ITC (If Eligible)

- **Action required:** File **IRS Form 5695** (Residential Energy Credits) with your federal tax return (Form 1040) for the year the system was placed in service.
- **Documentation needed:** Total system cost (including equipment, labor, and permitting), proof of system completion, and confirmation of your U.S.-sourced income.
- **Critical step:** Consult a Puerto Rico-licensed CPA before claiming.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Going solar in Puerto Rico is a smart financial decision, but these are the mistakes we see homeowners make most often when it comes to solar incentives:

### 1. Assuming You Qualify for the Federal ITC

This is the most common and most costly mistake. If all of your income is Puerto Rico-sourced, you almost certainly cannot claim the 30% federal tax credit. Do not let any installer tell you otherwise without backing it up with a CPA's analysis.

### 2. Waiting Indefinitely for a Free Solar Program

The PR-ERF and CDBG-MIT programs are real, but the wait can stretch months or even years. Meanwhile, electricity rates keep climbing. Many homeowners find that financing a system at $0 down — and starting to save immediately — is a better option than waiting in an uncertain queue.

### 3. Not Keeping Installation Records

Your property tax exemption lasts 25 years. Your net metering agreement, warranty documents, and equipment specs all matter over that time frame. Keep digital and physical copies of everything related to your solar installation.

### 4. Overlooking Battery Storage

Puerto Rico's grid reliability challenges make battery storage more than a luxury — it is a practical necessity. Batteries qualify for the same tax exemptions as panels. Skipping them to save upfront cost often means losing power (and the food in your refrigerator) during the next outage.

### 5. Choosing an Installer Based on Price Alone

The cheapest quote often comes with the most compromises — subcontracted crews, limited warranties, no local support. RIV Solar uses **in-house installation crews**, offers a **25-year warranty**, and provides **bilingual support** because we are part of this community, not just passing through.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you have to pay property tax on solar panels in Puerto Rico?

No. Under Puerto Rico's Green Energy Incentives Act (originally Act 83-2010), the value that a solar energy system adds to your property is 100% exempt from property taxes for 25 years. Your home value increases, but your property tax bill does not rise because of the solar installation.

### Can Puerto Rico residents claim the 30% federal solar tax credit?

Most cannot. The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) requires you to have federal income tax liability, and the majority of Puerto Rico residents do not pay federal income tax. However, if you have U.S.-sourced income and file a federal return (Form 1040), you may qualify. Always consult a Puerto Rico-licensed CPA before assuming eligibility.

### Is solar equipment exempt from sales tax in Puerto Rico?

Yes, as of early 2026. Puerto Rico law exempts solar panels, inverters, batteries, racking, and associated components from the sales and use tax (IVU). However, a 2025 tax reform proposal has put this exemption under legislative debate, so the status could change. Locking in your purchase while the exemption is active is a smart move.

### What free solar programs are available in Puerto Rico?

The two main programs are the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund (PR-ERF) and the CDBG-MIT solar initiatives administered through the Puerto Rico Department of Housing. These programs can cover 30% to 100% of installation costs for eligible residents, but most are currently waitlisted with limited new openings.

### How long does net metering last in Puerto Rico?

Puerto Rico's net metering policy is protected through at least 2031 under Act 10, signed in 2024. This means solar homeowners will continue to receive bill credits for excess energy sent to the LUMA grid for at least the next several years, providing long-term savings certainty.
