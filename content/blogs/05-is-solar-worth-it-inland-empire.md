# Is Solar Worth It in the Inland Empire? Local Savings Breakdown

**The short answer: The Inland Empire is one of the best places in California—and the entire United States—for solar.** With 285+ sunny days per year, brutal summer heat driving massive AC bills, and some of the highest electricity rates in the nation, IE homeowners are perfectly positioned to benefit from solar. SDG&E customers in south IE have the best solar ROI in America.

> **Quick Summary:** Inland Empire homeowners typically save $150-400/month with solar. Payback periods run 4-7 years depending on your utility. 25-year savings: $75,000-175,000. If you're paying $250+/month to SCE or $350+/month to SDG&E, solar is almost a no-brainer.

## Why the Inland Empire Is Solar Paradise

### 1. Exceptional Sunshine

The IE averages **285-300 sunny days per year**—far above the national average of 205.

| Location | Sunny Days/Year | Solar Advantage |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Riverside | 287 | +40% vs. national avg |
| San Bernardino | 284 | +38% |
| Palm Springs | 310 | +51% |
| Corona | 285 | +39% |
| Temecula | 289 | +41% |
| National Average | 205 | Baseline |

**More sun = more solar production = more savings.** An 8 kW system in Riverside produces ~12,500 kWh/year. The same system in Seattle produces ~9,000 kWh.

### 2. Extreme Summer Heat = Extreme Summer Bills

The IE gets HOT. Here's what that means for your electric bill:

| City | Avg Summer High | Typical Summer AC Bill |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Palm Springs | 108°F | $400-700/month |
| Hemet | 99°F | $350-550/month |
| San Bernardino | 98°F | $300-500/month |
| Riverside | 96°F | $280-450/month |
| Rancho Cucamonga | 93°F | $250-400/month |
| Corona | 95°F | $270-430/month |

**The solar advantage:** Panels produce the most electricity during the hottest, sunniest hours—exactly when your AC runs hardest. Peak production matches peak consumption.

### 3. High (and Rising) Utility Rates

The IE is split between two utilities—both expensive:

| Utility | 2026 Rate | 2020 Rate | 6-Year Increase |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| SCE (most of IE) | 42¢/kWh | 21¢/kWh | +100% |
| SDG&E (south IE) | 55¢/kWh | 27¢/kWh | +104% |

**SDG&E customers pay the highest rates in the continental United States.** If you're in Temecula, Murrieta, Menifee, or Wildomar, you're in SDG&E territory—and solar makes even more sense.

### 4. Strong Property Values

The IE housing market has appreciated significantly. Solar adds value:

| IE City | Median Home Value | Solar Premium (4-6%) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Corona | $725,000 | $29,000-43,500 |
| Rancho Cucamonga | $695,000 | $27,800-41,700 |
| Temecula | $650,000 | $26,000-39,000 |
| Riverside | $575,000 | $23,000-34,500 |
| Fontana | $545,000 | $21,800-32,700 |

## Real IE Homeowners, Real Results

**The Nguyen Family — Riverside, CA (SCE)**
> "Our summer bills were killing us—$520 in August 2024. We got a 10 kW system with one Powerwall. Our August 2025 bill? $14. We're saving over $400/month during summer. Annual savings are around $3,800."

## Battery Storage: Why It's Extra Important in the IE

Inland Empire homeowners should strongly consider battery storage:

### 1. Peak Rate Arbitrage

SCE and SDG&E use Time-of-Use (TOU) rates. Peak hours (4-9 PM) cost significantly more:

| Utility | Off-Peak Rate | Peak Rate | Difference |
|---------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| SCE | 35¢ | 54¢ | +54% |
| SDG&E | 42¢ | 68¢ | +62% |

With a battery:
- Store solar during day (when you produce excess)
- Use stored power during peak (when rates are highest)
- Avoid paying premium peak rates

### 2. Grid Instability During Heat Waves

The IE grid faces strain during summer:
- Flex alerts asking residents to reduce usage
- Rolling blackouts during extreme heat
- Voltage fluctuations damaging electronics

Battery backup keeps your AC running when the grid struggles.

### 3. Fire Season PSPS Events

Parts of the IE are in PSPS (Public Safety Power Shutoff) zones, particularly:
- Foothill communities
- Areas near wildland-urban interface
- Portions of Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego counties

**PSPS zones in the IE include areas of:**
- Yucaipa
- Redlands foothills
- Highland
- Parts of Riverside
- Temecula wine country
- Fallbrook/De Luz area

If you're in or near these areas, battery backup isn't a luxury—it's essential.

### 4. NEM 3.0 Value Optimization

Under NEM 3.0:

| What You Do | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Export excess solar to grid | 5-8¢ credit |
| Store excess, use at peak | 50-65¢ saved |
| **Difference** | **~10x more value with battery** |

## IE-Specific Incentives

### Federal (Everyone Gets This):
- **30% Investment Tax Credit** on solar AND battery

### California State:
- **Property Tax Exemption** — Solar doesn't increase your property taxes
- **SGIP Battery Rebate** — $150-1,000/kWh depending on eligibility

### SDG&E Territory Special Programs:
- Enhanced SGIP rebates for high fire-threat districts
- Many Temecula/Murrieta areas qualify for **$850/kWh** (vs. $150/kWh general)
- On a 13.5 kWh Powerwall: **$11,475 rebate** vs. $2,025

### SCE Territory:
- Standard SGIP rates ($150/kWh general, higher for equity-eligible)
- Various TOU rate plan options optimized for solar

---

## Common IE Questions

### "My house is older—will solar work?"
Most IE homes built after 1960 can support solar. Older homes may need:
- Electrical panel upgrade (from 100A to 200A): $2,000-3,500
- Roof assessment to confirm structural adequacy

We've installed on homes from 1950s ranch houses to brand-new construction.

### "I have a tile roof"
Tile roofs are common in the IE, and we work with them regularly:
- Tiles are carefully removed for mounting
- Special tile hooks or comp-out methods used
- Tiles replaced around mounts
- **Cost impact:** +$1,000-2,500 vs. composition shingle

### "My HOA is strict"
California's Solar Rights Act prohibits HOAs from blocking solar. They can request:
- Specific panel placement (within reason)
- All-black panels for aesthetics
- Architectural approval (they must approve within 45 days)

They **cannot** deny your right to go solar.

### "I have a pool"
Pool pumps are electricity hogs—typically adding $75-150/month to your bill. **This makes solar economics even better.** Size your system to include pool pump usage.

**Pro tip:** Variable-speed pool pumps use 70% less energy than single-speed. Consider upgrading when you go solar.

### "We're on CARE/FERA discounts"
Low-income utility discounts reduce your bill 30-35%. Solar can still make sense, but:
- Payback period is longer
- You may qualify for **equity SGIP rebates** ($850-1,000/kWh)
- Free solar programs (DAC-SASH) may be available

Let us check your eligibility—you might get solar nearly free.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does solar cost in the Inland Empire?
Average systems run $22,000-$38,000 before the 30% federal tax credit. After incentives, expect $15,000-$27,000 for a typical single-family home. SDG&E customers with high bills often qualify for larger systems with better per-watt economics.

### What's the best solar company in the Inland Empire?
Look for: local California installers (not out-of-state chains), in-house crews (no subcontractors), 25-year comprehensive warranties, and no-pressure sales. Get 2-3 quotes and compare both price and warranty terms.

### How long does solar installation take in the IE?
Physical installation: 1-2 days. Total process including permits: 6-10 weeks. Riverside County and San Bernardino County have reasonably efficient permitting; San Diego County (Temecula area) is also straightforward.

### Do I need a battery for solar in the IE?
Strongly recommended. TOU rates mean batteries pay for themselves through peak-rate avoidance. Plus, if you're in a PSPS zone or experience summer grid issues, backup power is invaluable.

### Is community solar available in the Inland Empire?
Some community solar options exist in SCE territory, but savings are much lower than rooftop solar (typically 5-10% discount vs. 80%+ savings with owned solar). If you can install on your roof, rooftop is far better.
