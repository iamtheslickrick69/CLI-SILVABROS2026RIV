# Do I Need Battery Storage with Solar? When It Makes Sense

**The short answer: In California under NEM 3.0, battery storage has gone from "nice to have" to "strongly recommended."** Batteries maximize your solar savings by letting you use your own power during expensive peak hours instead of sending it to the grid for low credits. Plus, you get backup power during outages. Here's when batteries make sense and when you can skip them.

## The NEM 3.0 Game-Changer

California's NEM 3.0 policy (April 2023) fundamentally changed the battery calculation.

### Before NEM 3.0:
- Export excess solar to grid → Get nearly retail credit
- Battery optional (nice for backup, not critical for savings)

### Under NEM 3.0:
- Export excess solar to grid → Get 5-8¢/kWh credit (not 40-55¢)
- Battery captures that value instead

### The Math:

| What You Do With 1 kWh | NEM 2.0 Value | NEM 3.0 Value |
|------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Export to grid | ~40¢ | ~6¢ |
| Store and use at peak | ~40¢ | ~55¢ |
| **Difference** | $0 | **~50¢** |

Under NEM 3.0, every kWh you store instead of export is worth nearly **10x more**.

## When You SHOULD Get a Battery

### 1. You're Installing Solar Under NEM 3.0

If you're a new solar customer in 2026, batteries aren't optional for optimal economics.

**Without battery:** Much of your daytime solar production goes to the grid for 5-8¢/kWh, then you buy evening power at 45-55¢/kWh.

**With battery:** Store daytime excess, use it during peak hours (4-9 PM), avoid buying expensive grid power.

### 2. You Live in a PSPS (Blackout) Zone

PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E all conduct Public Safety Power Shutoffs during fire season. If you've experienced these:

- Without battery: Your solar shuts off during outages (safety requirement)
- With battery: Your home runs on stored power while neighbors go dark

### 3. You Have Time-of-Use Rates with Big Peak Differentials

California TOU rates charge premium prices during peak hours (4-9 PM):

| Utility | Off-Peak Rate | Peak Rate | Savings from Battery |
|---------|---------------|-----------|---------------------|
| SDG&E | 45¢ | 65¢ | 20¢/kWh |
| PG&E | 38¢ | 55¢ | 17¢/kWh |
| SCE | 35¢ | 54¢ | 19¢/kWh |

Batteries let you avoid the premium.

### 4. You Work from Home

If you're home during the day, you use more solar directly. But if your usage still peaks in evening hours (cooking, AC, entertainment), a battery captures the midday excess for evening use.

### 5. You Have Medical Equipment

If anyone in your household relies on:
- CPAP machines
- Oxygen concentrators
- Refrigerated medications
- Dialysis equipment
- Electric wheelchairs

A battery provides critical backup.

### 6. You Want True Energy Independence

Some homeowners simply don't want to depend on the grid. With solar + adequate battery, you can achieve near-complete energy independence.

---

## When You Might SKIP a Battery

### 1. Tight Budget, Maximizing Solar First

If funds are limited, getting solar first still saves money. You can add a battery later (though it's more expensive than installing together).

**Strategy:** Size your solar system with future battery in mind, add battery when budget allows.

### 2. No Outage History

If you've never experienced outages and aren't in a PSPS zone, the backup benefit has less value.

### 3. Daytime Electricity Usage

If you use most electricity during solar production hours (home all day, pool pump running midday, EV charging during day), you naturally self-consume more and export less.

### 4. Existing NEM 2.0 Customer

If you went solar before April 2023, you're grandfathered into NEM 2.0 for 20 years. Exporting excess still gets good credits, making batteries less critical (though still useful for backup).

## Battery Economics Under NEM 3.0

Let's run the numbers:

### Scenario: 8 kW solar system, 10,000 kWh annual production

**Without Battery:**
- Self-consumed: 35% (3,500 kWh) @ 45¢ saved = $1,575
- Exported: 65% (6,500 kWh) @ 6¢ credit = $390
- Evening purchases: 4,000 kWh @ 50¢ = -$2,000
- **Net annual value: -$35** (slight cost)

**With 13.5 kWh Battery:**
- Self-consumed directly: 35% (3,500 kWh) @ 45¢ = $1,575
- Battery-shifted to peak: 45% (4,500 kWh) @ 55¢ = $2,475
- Exported: 20% (2,000 kWh) @ 6¢ = $120
- Evening purchases: 1,000 kWh @ 50¢ = -$500
- **Net annual value: $3,670**

### Battery ROI:

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Battery cost (installed) | $12,000 |
| 30% tax credit | -$3,600 |
| SGIP rebate | -$2,000 |
| **Net battery cost** | **$6,400** |
| Annual added value | $3,705 |
| **Battery payback** | **1.7 years** |

Under NEM 3.0, batteries pay for themselves faster than solar panels.

## How Much Battery Do You Need?

### Sizing for Economics (Peak Shifting):

**Goal:** Store enough to cover peak hours (4-9 PM = 5 hours)

| Evening Usage | Battery Size Needed |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 2 kWh/hour | 10 kWh |
| 3 kWh/hour | 15 kWh |
| 4 kWh/hour | 20 kWh |
| 5 kWh/hour | 25 kWh |

**Rule of thumb:** 10-15 kWh handles most homes. Larger homes or heavy AC use may need 20-27 kWh.

### Sizing for Backup:

**Goal:** Run essential loads during outages

| Backup Goal | Battery Size |
|-------------|--------------|
| Essentials only (fridge, lights, phones) | 10 kWh |
| Essentials + some comfort | 13-15 kWh |
| Most of home | 20-27 kWh |
| Whole home including AC | 27-40 kWh |

## Common Battery Questions

### "Can I add a battery to existing solar?"

Yes. You can retrofit a battery to any solar system, though:
- May require inverter upgrade
- Installation cost is higher than doing it with solar
- Still qualifies for 30% tax credit

### "Will one battery run my whole house?"

Depends on your usage:
- **13.5 kWh battery:** Runs essentials for 12-24 hours, whole home for 4-8 hours
- **27 kWh (two batteries):** Whole home for 8-16 hours, essentials for days

AC is the big variable. Running AC depletes batteries quickly.

### "How long do batteries last?"

Most batteries are warrantied for 10-15 years with guaranteed capacity retention (70-80% of original). Real-world lifespan is often 15-20 years.

### "Can I go off-grid with a battery?"

Technically yes, but usually not practical or recommended. You'd need:
- Very large battery bank
- Oversized solar array
- Backup generator
- Higher system cost

Staying grid-connected provides reliability at lower cost.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does a solar battery cost in California?
$10,000-$15,000 installed for a typical 13-15 kWh battery. After 30% tax credit and SGIP rebate, net cost is $5,000-$9,000.

### Do I need a battery for solar to work?
No. Solar works without a battery—but under NEM 3.0, you'll export excess at low value instead of capturing it for peak use.

### Can solar panels charge the battery during an outage?
Yes. With a properly designed system, your panels continue charging your battery during the day, even when the grid is down.

### What happens when the battery is full?
Excess production either goes to the grid (for credits) or is curtailed. Proper system sizing minimizes waste.

### Is one brand significantly better than others?
All major brands (Tesla, Enphase, Franklin, Generac) are reliable. Choice often comes down to capacity needs, warranty preference, and installer certification.

### Can I use my EV as a battery?
Some EVs support Vehicle-to-Home (V2H), but it's not yet widespread. Dedicated home batteries are currently more practical.
