# Puerto Rico Net Metering Extended to 2030: What It Means for You

**While mainland states are cutting solar incentives, Puerto Rico is doing the opposite.** Governor Pedro Pierluisi signed legislation extending the island's generous net metering program through at least 2030 — making this one of the best times ever to go solar in PR.

Here's what this policy means for Puerto Rican homeowners.

## What Is Net Metering?

Net metering allows your solar panels to "spin the meter backwards." When your system produces more electricity than you're using, the excess flows to LUMA's grid — and you receive credits at the full retail rate.

### Simple Example

| Time | Production | Usage | Net |
|------|------------|-------|-----|
| 10 AM | 5 kWh | 1 kWh | +4 kWh (credit) |
| 2 PM | 6 kWh | 2 kWh | +4 kWh (credit) |
| 8 PM | 0 kWh | 3 kWh | -3 kWh (use credits) |
| **Daily Net** | 11 kWh | 6 kWh | **+5 kWh (banked)** |

At the end of the month, you only pay for your *net* usage — the difference between what you produced and consumed.

## Why Puerto Rico's Policy Is Special

### Compare to California (NEM 3.0)

| Factor | Puerto Rico | California |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Export Credit Rate | **Full retail** (~$0.30/kWh) | ~$0.08/kWh (~25% retail) |
| Policy Stability | **Guaranteed to 2030** | Subject to change |
| Battery Required? | No | Essentially yes |
| Credit Value | **High** | Low |

California's NEM 3.0 cut solar export credits by about 75%. Puerto Rico went the opposite direction and *protected* its generous policy.

### What This Means Financially

For a system that exports 500 kWh/month:

| Location | Monthly Credit Value |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Puerto Rico** | **$150** (500 × $0.30) |
| California | $40 (500 × $0.08) |
| **Difference** | **+$110/month** |

Over 25 years, that difference adds up to over **$33,000** more value for PR solar owners.

## How Puerto Rico Net Metering Works

### Step 1: Interconnection Agreement

Your installer submits paperwork to LUMA:
- System specifications
- Single-line diagram
- Proof of insurance
- Site assessment

### Step 2: Meter Upgrade

LUMA installs a bidirectional (net) meter:
- Tracks energy flowing both ways
- No cost to homeowner
- Same meter location

### Step 3: Automatic Credits

Once activated:
- Excess production credited automatically
- Credits appear on monthly bill
- No action required from you

### Credit Rollover

| Month | Production | Usage | Credits |
|-------|------------|-------|---------|
| March | 1,200 kWh | 800 kWh | +400 banked |
| April | 1,100 kWh | 750 kWh | +750 banked |
| May | 1,000 kWh | 900 kWh | +850 banked |
| June | 900 kWh | 1,200 kWh | +550 banked |
| July | 850 kWh | 1,300 kWh | +100 banked |
| August | 900 kWh | 1,400 kWh | -400 (use credits) |

Credits accumulate during lower-usage months (winter/spring) and offset high-usage months (summer AC season).

## The 2030 Extension: Key Details

### What the Law Guarantees

- **1:1 retail credit rate** for exported solar
- **Monthly credit rollover** without expiration
- **No additional fees** for net metering participation
- **Protection through December 31, 2030**

### Who Qualifies

- Residential solar systems
- Commercial systems (up to limits)
- New and existing installations
- Grid-connected systems with approved inverters

### What Happens After 2030?

The legislature will revisit the policy before expiration. Given Puerto Rico's:
- High electricity costs
- Grid reliability issues
- Climate goals
- Public support for solar

...it's likely net metering will be extended or a similarly favorable policy adopted.

## Maximizing Your Net Metering Value

### 1. Right-Size Your System

The goal is to produce about 100-110% of your annual usage:
- Too small: You still pay LUMA for the difference
- Too big: Excess credits accumulate with diminishing value
- Just right: Maximum savings, optimal investment

### 2. Consider Battery Storage

While net metering is generous, batteries add value:
- Store solar for evening use (avoid peak rates if implemented)
- Backup power during outages (critical in PR)
- Future-proof against policy changes

### 3. Monitor Your Production

Use your system's monitoring app to:
- Track daily/monthly production
- Verify credit calculations
- Identify performance issues
- Optimize energy usage

## Net Metering vs. Battery Storage

Some ask: "If net metering is so good, why get a battery?"

### Net Metering Benefits
- No additional cost
- Full retail credit for exports
- Simple, automatic

### Battery Benefits
- Power during outages (essential in PR)
- Independence from LUMA's reliability
- Future-proof against policy changes
- Time-of-use optimization (if implemented)

**Our recommendation:** In Puerto Rico, get both. Net metering maximizes savings, battery provides security.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will my LUMA bill go to zero?

You'll still pay:
- Minimum customer charge (~$3-5/month)
- Any net usage beyond credits

Most solar homes reduce bills to near-zero.

### What if I produce more than I use all year?

Annual excess is typically credited at a lower "avoided cost" rate. Proper system sizing prevents this.

### Does net metering work with battery?

Yes! Your system can:
- Store solar in battery for your use
- Export excess to grid for credits
- Draw from battery during outages

### Can LUMA change the policy before 2030?

The law protects net metering through 2030. While modifications are technically possible, significant changes would require legislative action.

### What about time-of-use rates?

If LUMA implements TOU rates, net metering credits would follow the rate at time of export. This could make midday exports less valuable — another reason to consider battery storage.

## The Bottom Line

Puerto Rico's net metering extension through 2030 is exceptional news for homeowners:

- **Guaranteed policy stability** for 5+ years
- **Full retail credit** for exported solar
- **Significant savings** compared to mainland policies
- **Excellent ROI** on solar investment

Combined with the 30% federal tax credit, property/sales tax exemptions, and LUMA's high rates, there has never been a better time to go solar in Puerto Rico.

The window is open. The policy is protected. The savings are real.
