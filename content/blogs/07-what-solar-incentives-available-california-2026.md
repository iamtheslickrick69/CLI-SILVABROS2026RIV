# What Solar Incentives Are Available in California in 2026?

**The short answer: California homeowners can access the 30% federal tax credit, SGIP battery rebates, property tax exemptions, and various local utility incentives.** Combined, these programs can reduce your solar investment by 35-45%. Here's the complete guide to every incentive available in 2026.

## Overview: California Solar Incentives in 2026

| Incentive | Value | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Federal Investment Tax Credit | 30% of system cost | Active through 2032 |
| CA Property Tax Exemption | 100% of added value | Active (permanent) |
| SGIP Battery Rebate | $150-$1,000/kWh | Active (while funds last) |
| NEM 3.0 Net Metering | Bill credits for exports | Active |
| Local Utility Rebates | Varies | Check your utility |
| DAC-SASH Program | Free solar for qualifying households | Active |

Let's break down each one.

## 1. Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) — 30%

The biggest incentive available is federal, not state—but it's available to all California homeowners.

### How It Works:
Deduct 30% of your total solar system cost (including batteries) from your federal income taxes.

### Example:
- System cost: $32,000
- 30% credit: **$9,600 back**
- Net cost: $22,400

### Key Details:
- Must own the system (not lease)
- Battery storage qualifies if charged by solar
- Credit rolls forward if you can't use it all in one year
- Available through 2032 at 30%

### How to Claim:
File IRS Form 5695 with your tax return.

## 2. California Property Tax Exemption — 100%

California provides a **full property tax exemption** for the added value of solar installations.

### How It Works:
Normally, home improvements increase your property's assessed value, raising your property taxes. Solar is exempt from this.

### Example:
- Solar adds $25,000 to home value
- Normal property tax increase: ~$250/year
- **With exemption: $0 increase**

### Key Details:
- Automatic—no application needed
- Applies to systems installed through 2027 (likely to be extended)
- Covers solar panels, inverters, and storage
- No maximum limit

### Why This Matters:
You get the home value boost without the tax penalty. When you sell, your home is worth more. While you own it, you don't pay extra taxes.

## 3. SGIP (Self-Generation Incentive Program) — Battery Rebates

The Self-Generation Incentive Program offers rebates for battery storage systems in California.

### Current Rebate Levels (2026):

| Category | Rebate per kWh | Example (13.5 kWh battery) |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| General Market | $150/kWh | $2,025 |
| Equity Budget | $850/kWh | $11,475 |
| Equity Resiliency | $1,000/kWh | $13,500 |

### Who Qualifies for Equity Budgets?
Higher rebates are available if you:
- Live in a disadvantaged community (DAC)
- Have household income below 80% of area median
- Are enrolled in CARE/FERA or other assistance programs
- Live in a high fire-threat district (Tier 2 or 3)

### How to Apply:
1. Your solar installer submits the application
2. Rebate is reserved
3. System is installed
4. Rebate is paid (usually to installer, reducing your cost)

### Key Warning:
SGIP funds are limited and distributed in "steps." As each step's funding runs out, rebate amounts decrease. Current availability varies by utility territory. Check early—these funds can deplete quickly.

## 4. NEM 3.0 — Net Energy Metering

While technically a billing structure rather than an incentive, NEM 3.0 still provides value for solar production.

### How It Works:
When your solar produces more than you use, excess energy flows to the grid. You receive bill credits for these exports, though at reduced rates compared to old NEM 2.0.

### NEM 3.0 Export Rates (approximate):
- **Peak hours (4-9 PM):** 5-8¢/kWh credit
- **Off-peak hours:** 2-4¢/kWh credit
- **Super off-peak:** 1-3¢/kWh credit

### Why Batteries Matter More Now:
Under NEM 2.0, sending excess solar to the grid was almost as good as using it yourself. Under NEM 3.0, using or storing your solar is much better than exporting it.

**Strategy:** Size your system for self-consumption and add batteries to capture excess production for evening use.

### Key Protection:
Once you go solar, your NEM terms are locked in for 9 years, regardless of future policy changes.

## 5. Local Utility Incentives

Beyond statewide programs, some utilities offer additional incentives:

### SDG&E (San Diego Gas & Electric)
- NEM 3.0 structure
- SGIP battery rebates
- Time-of-Use rate options optimized for solar

### SCE (Southern California Edison)
- NEM 3.0 structure
- SGIP battery rebates
- Various rate plans for solar customers
- Potential EV charging incentives when combined with solar

### PG&E (Pacific Gas & Electric)
- NEM 3.0 structure
- SGIP battery rebates
- Enhanced PSPS (blackout) considerations for battery backup

### Municipal Utilities
Some cities have their own electric utilities with different incentive structures:
- **LADWP (Los Angeles):** Own incentive program, different from NEM
- **Riverside Public Utilities:** Local rebates may apply
- **Anaheim Public Utilities:** Check for current offerings

**Always verify current incentives with your specific utility.**

## 6. DAC-SASH Program — Free Solar for Qualifying Households

The Disadvantaged Communities - Single-family Solar Homes (DAC-SASH) program provides **free solar installations** to qualifying low-income homeowners.

### Who Qualifies:
- Own and live in your home
- Household income at or below 80% of Area Median Income
- Live in a disadvantaged community (DAC)
- Have a home suitable for solar

### What's Covered:
- Full cost of solar installation
- No out-of-pocket expense
- You own the system

### How to Apply:
GRID Alternatives administers this program. Visit gridalternatives.org or contact them for eligibility assessment.

### Similar Programs:
- **SASH (Solar on Affordable Housing):** For affordable housing properties
- **SOMAH:** For multifamily affordable housing

## 7. Additional Tax Benefits

### Federal Tax Treatment
- Solar loan interest is NOT deductible
- However, if you use a home equity loan for solar, that interest MAY be deductible as mortgage interest

### California State Tax
- California doesn't have a separate state solar tax credit
- The federal credit doesn't reduce your state tax liability
- However, the property tax exemption provides ongoing value

### Depreciation (Business Use)
If you use part of your home for business (home office), you may be able to depreciate a portion of your solar system. Consult a tax professional.

## Stacking Incentives: Maximum Savings

Here's how a California homeowner might stack incentives:

### Example: General Market Customer

| Component | Cost/Credit |
|-----------|-------------|
| Solar System (8 kW) | $25,600 |
| Battery (13.5 kWh) | $12,000 |
| **Gross Total** | **$37,600** |
| Federal ITC (30%) | -$11,280 |
| SGIP Battery Rebate ($150/kWh) | -$2,025 |
| **Net Cost** | **$24,295** |
| Property Tax Exemption (ongoing) | $0/year extra |

**Total Incentive Value: $13,305** (35% reduction)

### Example: Equity-Eligible Customer

| Component | Cost/Credit |
|-----------|-------------|
| Solar System (8 kW) | $25,600 |
| Battery (13.5 kWh) | $12,000 |
| **Gross Total** | **$37,600** |
| Federal ITC (30%) | -$11,280 |
| SGIP Equity Rebate ($850/kWh) | -$11,475 |
| **Net Cost** | **$14,845** |

**Total Incentive Value: $22,755** (61% reduction)

## Incentives That Have Ended

For clarity, these former incentives are **no longer available**:

### California Solar Initiative (CSI)
Ended in 2016. Was a direct rebate per watt installed.

### NEM 2.0
Closed to new customers in April 2023. If you already have NEM 2.0, you keep it for 20 years.

### Higher SGIP Rebate Steps
Earlier SGIP steps offered higher rebates. Current steps are lower but still valuable.

## How to Maximize Your Incentives

### 1. Go Solar Sooner
The federal 30% credit is guaranteed through 2032, but SGIP funds can run out. Lock in available incentives before they decrease.

### 2. Include Battery Storage
Batteries qualify for both the federal tax credit AND SGIP rebates. They also maximize your solar value under NEM 3.0.

### 3. Check Equity Eligibility
If you might qualify for equity-tier SGIP rebates (income-based or location-based), the savings are substantial. Ask your installer to check.

### 4. Work With an Experienced Installer
A good solar company knows all available incentives and handles the paperwork. They should maximize your savings, not just sell you panels.

### 5. Keep Records
Save all documentation for tax filing and warranty purposes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the total I can save with incentives in California?
Combining federal tax credit, SGIP rebates, and property tax exemption, most homeowners save 35-45% on total solar + battery costs. Equity-eligible customers can save 50-65%.

### Do I need to apply for the property tax exemption?
No. It's automatic for solar installations in California. Your county assessor excludes the solar value from property tax calculations.

### How do I know if SGIP funds are still available?
Your installer can check current SGIP step levels and fund availability for your utility territory. You can also check the CPUC SGIP website.

### Can I get incentives if I lease solar panels?
The federal tax credit goes to the system owner—with a lease, that's the leasing company, not you. They may pass some savings through as lower lease payments. Property tax exemption still applies.

### Is there an income limit for the federal tax credit?
No. The federal ITC has no income limit. Anyone with federal tax liability can claim it, regardless of income level.

### Will these incentives still be available next year?
The federal 30% credit is guaranteed through 2032. SGIP funds fluctuate—may or may not be available. Property tax exemption is currently authorized through 2027 but likely to be extended.
