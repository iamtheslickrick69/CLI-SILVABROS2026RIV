# How to Apply for Free Solar Programs in Puerto Rico

**Puerto Rico offers federally funded programs -- primarily the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund (PR-ERF) and CDBG-MIT initiatives -- that provide free solar panels and battery systems to eligible homeowners. Applications are income-based, use a lottery and waitlist system, and open only periodically. Here is exactly how to apply, what to prepare, and what to do if you do not qualify.**

---

## Key Takeaways

- **PR-ERF and CDBG-MIT are the two main free solar programs** in Puerto Rico, both funded by federal disaster recovery dollars and designed to strengthen household energy resilience after hurricanes.
- **Applications open in limited windows** and use a lottery system -- preparation and timing are critical to getting selected.
- **Eligibility is income-based**, generally targeting households at or below 80% of Area Median Income, with priority given to elderly residents, people with disabilities, and medically vulnerable families.
- **Scams targeting applicants are common** -- never pay an application fee or share personal information with unofficial third parties claiming to guarantee placement.
- **If you do not qualify or cannot wait**, $0 down solar financing through [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com) gets you solar and battery backup in weeks instead of months or years.

## Overview: Free Solar Programs Available in Puerto Rico

Puerto Rico is one of the few places in the United States where you can receive a fully installed solar panel and battery storage system at absolutely no cost. This is not a tax credit, a rebate, or a discount. It is a direct installation program where the government covers everything -- equipment, labor, permitting, and interconnection.

These programs exist because Puerto Rico's electrical grid remains one of the most fragile in the nation. After Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the island's power infrastructure in 2017, the federal government allocated billions in disaster recovery funding. A significant portion of that money was earmarked for energy resilience, and residential solar installations became a core strategy.

There are two primary programs to know about:

1. **Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund (PR-ERF)** -- The flagship residential solar program providing individual homeowners with complete solar-plus-battery systems.
2. **CDBG-MIT (Community Development Block Grant -- Mitigation)** -- The broader federal initiative that funds PR-ERF and additional community-level solar and resilience projects.

Understanding how these programs work -- and how to position yourself for selection -- can mean the difference between getting a free system and waiting indefinitely.

## PR-ERF: Program Details and Eligibility

The Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund is the program most homeowners are looking for. If selected, you receive a solar panel array and battery storage system sized to cover essential household loads like refrigeration, lighting, medical devices, and basic appliances during grid outages.

### Who Is Eligible?

PR-ERF eligibility requirements can shift slightly between enrollment periods, but the core criteria remain consistent:

- **Puerto Rico residency** -- You must live on the island full-time.
- **Homeownership** -- You must own the property where the system would be installed. Renters are generally not eligible for the residential program.
- **Income limits** -- The program targets low- to moderate-income households. Eligibility is typically based on HUD's Area Median Income (AMI) guidelines, with households at or below 80% AMI receiving priority.
- **Structural suitability** -- Your roof and electrical system must be capable of supporting a solar installation. Homes with severe structural damage may need repairs first.
- **No duplicate benefits** -- If you already received a free solar system through another federal program, you are likely ineligible.

### Who Gets Priority?

Even among eligible applicants, certain groups receive higher priority:

- Elderly residents (65+)
- Persons with disabilities
- Households with members dependent on electrically powered medical equipment
- Families in areas with the most frequent and prolonged grid outages
- Households previously displaced by hurricane damage

If you fall into one or more of these categories, make sure your application clearly documents it. Priority status can significantly improve your chances in the lottery.

## CDBG-MIT: The Broader Initiative

CDBG-MIT is the parent program that funds PR-ERF. Understanding this broader initiative matters because it opens up additional pathways to free or subsidized solar.

Beyond individual residential installations, CDBG-MIT funds:

- **Community solar projects** for multi-family housing and public buildings
- **Microgrid development** in vulnerable neighborhoods
- **Home repair programs** that can make your property eligible for future solar installation
- **Infrastructure resilience projects** across municipalities

### Why This Matters for Your Application

If you do not qualify for PR-ERF directly, CDBG-MIT community programs may still apply to your situation. For example, if your home needs structural repairs before it can support solar panels, a CDBG-MIT home repair grant could address that barrier. Ask your municipal office about all available CDBG-MIT programs -- not just the solar component.

## How to Apply: Step-by-Step Guide

The PR-ERF application process is straightforward in concept but requires careful preparation and timing. Here is exactly what to do.

### Step 1: Check Whether Applications Are Open

This is the most important step, and the one that frustrates people the most. PR-ERF does not accept applications continuously. Enrollment windows open periodically, stay open for a limited time, and then close -- sometimes for months.

**Where to check:**

- The official Puerto Rico Department of Housing (Departamento de la Vivienda) website
- The designated PR-ERF application portal
- Dial 211 for program updates in both Spanish and English
- Your local municipal office (oficina municipal)

**What to do if applications are closed:** Bookmark the official portal and check back at least twice per month. You can also ask your municipal office to notify you when the next window opens. Some community organizations and nonprofits track enrollment periods and send alerts to registered residents.

### Step 2: Gather Your Documentation Before the Window Opens

Do not wait until applications open to start collecting paperwork. When enrollment windows open, they can fill quickly. Having everything ready in advance gives you a significant advantage.

**Documents you will typically need:**

- Government-issued photo ID (Real ID, driver's license, or passport)
- Proof of Puerto Rico residency (utility bill, bank statement, or government correspondence)
- Proof of homeownership (property deed or property tax records -- CRIM documentation)
- Income verification (recent pay stubs, federal or Puerto Rico tax returns, Social Security benefit statements, or pension documentation)
- Recent LUMA Energy electricity bill (showing your account number and usage)
- Medical documentation (if you or a household member relies on electrically powered medical equipment -- include a doctor's letter)
- Household composition information (number of people living in the home, ages, and any disability documentation)

> **Pro Tip:** Make digital copies (scans or clear photos) of every document. Online applications often require file uploads, and having everything in a folder on your phone or computer saves time when the window opens.

### Step 3: Submit Your Application Promptly

When the enrollment window opens, submit your application as soon as possible. While the selection process uses a lottery rather than first-come-first-served, submitting early ensures you avoid technical issues, server overloads, or missing the window if it closes earlier than expected.

Applications are available in **both Spanish and English**. Most submissions are handled online through the designated portal, though some enrollment periods offer in-person assistance at:

- Community centers (centros comunales)
- Municipal offices
- Designated outreach events in partnership with nonprofits

If you are not comfortable with online applications, ask for in-person help. Do not let the digital format stop you from applying.

### Step 4: Confirm Submission and Save Your Confirmation

After submitting, you should receive a confirmation number or email. **Save this.** If there are any issues with your application or you need to follow up, this confirmation is your proof of submission.

### Step 5: Wait for Lottery Results

After the enrollment window closes, eligible applications enter a lottery process. This is not instantaneous -- expect to wait several weeks to months before receiving notification. If selected, you will be contacted with next steps, including scheduling a home assessment to verify that your property can support the installation.

If you are not selected in a given cycle, your application may remain in the system for future rounds depending on the program rules at that time. You can also reapply during the next open enrollment window.

---

## What to Expect: Realistic Timeline

Setting realistic expectations about timing will save you frustration. Here is what the PR-ERF application process typically looks like from start to finish:

| Stage | Estimated Timeline |
|---|---|
| Waiting for application window to open | Varies -- could be weeks or months |
| Application submission and review | 4-8 weeks |
| Lottery selection and notification | 2-4 months after enrollment closes |
| Home assessment and structural approval | 1-3 months after selection |
| Installation scheduling and completion | 2-6 months after approval |
| **Total from application to powered-on system** | **6-18+ months** |

These timelines are estimates based on past enrollment cycles. Federal funding, contractor availability, equipment supply chains, and administrative capacity all affect the pace. Some applicants have waited over a year. Others have moved through the process in under six months.

The takeaway: apply and then plan accordingly. Do not put your household's energy needs entirely on hold while waiting for a government program.

## Tips for Improving Your PR-ERF Application

While the selection process involves a lottery, there are concrete steps you can take to strengthen your application and avoid disqualification.

### 1. Document Everything Thoroughly

Incomplete applications are the most common reason for disqualification. Double-check that every required field is filled out and every required document is attached. If a form asks for income verification and you are self-employed, provide multiple forms of documentation (bank statements, tax filings, client contracts) rather than leaving it ambiguous.

### 2. Highlight Priority Factors

If anyone in your household is elderly, has a disability, relies on medical equipment, or was previously displaced by a hurricane, make sure this is clearly documented in your application. These factors receive priority consideration and can improve your position in the selection process.

### 3. Ensure Your Home Is Structurally Ready

Applications for homes with severe roof damage, outdated electrical panels, or other structural issues may be deferred or denied. If you know your roof needs work, consider addressing it before applying -- or explore CDBG-MIT home repair programs that could handle repairs and make your home eligible.

### 4. Keep Your LUMA Account in Good Standing

While not always an explicit requirement, having an active LUMA Energy account in good standing demonstrates that you are a current utility customer and simplifies the interconnection process after installation.

### 5. Apply to Multiple Programs

Do not limit yourself to PR-ERF alone. Check whether your municipality has its own solar assistance programs, and ask about community solar projects under CDBG-MIT. Some nonprofit organizations also facilitate solar installations for low-income households. Cast a wide net.

### 6. Follow Up Without Being Passive

After submitting, check on your application status periodically. Call 211, visit your municipal office, or contact the administering agency. Bureaucratic processes sometimes stall, and a polite follow-up can ensure your application does not fall through the cracks.

## Common Scams to Avoid

Any time a government program offers something free, scammers follow. Puerto Rico's free solar programs are no exception. Protect yourself by watching for these red flags.

### Never Pay an Application Fee

The PR-ERF application is free. Period. If anyone -- a company, a door-to-door salesperson, a website, or a social media ad -- asks you to pay a fee to "apply," "guarantee your spot," or "expedite your application," it is a scam. Report it immediately.

### Beware of Unofficial "Application Assistance" Services

Some companies market themselves as PR-ERF application helpers and charge fees for services you can do yourself for free. The official application process is available directly through the Puerto Rico Department of Housing portal and through free assistance at municipal offices and community centers.

### Do Not Share Personal Information With Unverified Sources

Your Social Security number, bank account information, and other sensitive data should only be shared through the official application portal. If someone contacts you claiming to be from PR-ERF and asks for this information over the phone or via text message, verify their identity through official channels before providing anything.

### Watch for "Guaranteed Selection" Claims

No one can guarantee you will be selected in the PR-ERF lottery. Any person or company promising guaranteed placement is lying. The selection process is administered by government agencies, not private brokers.

### Verify Installer Credentials

If you are contacted by a company claiming to be the PR-ERF installer for your area, verify their credentials through the official program before allowing anyone onto your property or signing any documents. Legitimate contractors will be able to provide verifiable program documentation.

> **If something feels off, it probably is.** The safest approach is to interact only with official government channels and verified program administrators. When in doubt, call 211.

## What If You Do Not Qualify? Your Alternatives

The reality of free solar programs in Puerto Rico is that demand vastly exceeds supply. Application windows close quickly, the waitlist stretches for months, and income requirements exclude many middle-income families who still struggle with electricity costs exceeding $300-400 per month.

If any of the following apply to you, a government program may not be your fastest path to solar:

- Your income is above the 80% AMI threshold
- You cannot wait 6-18+ months for an installation
- Applications are closed and you need power resilience now
- You were not selected in a previous lottery cycle

### $0 Down Solar Financing

Companies like [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com) offer $0 down financing that eliminates the upfront cost barrier. Your monthly payment is often less than what you currently pay LUMA Energy, meaning you start saving from day one. The timeline from consultation to a powered-on system is typically **4-8 weeks** -- not months or years.

What RIV Solar specifically offers Puerto Rico homeowners:

- **$0 down financing** with payments frequently lower than current LUMA bills
- **Solar panels plus battery storage** -- because backup power is not optional on an island with chronic outages
- **In-house installation crews** -- no subcontractors, better quality control
- **Bilingual support** in English and Spanish throughout the entire process
- **25-year warranty** covering panels, batteries, and workmanship

### Tax Exemptions Apply Either Way

Whether you receive a free system through PR-ERF or purchase your own, Puerto Rico's **sales tax exemption on solar equipment** and **property tax exemption on solar-added home value** still apply. These incentives make private solar installation significantly more affordable.

### Apply and Finance Simultaneously

Here is the smartest strategy: apply for PR-ERF and explore private financing at the same time. If you get selected for the free program, great -- cancel or pause your private plans. If you do not get selected, you are not stuck waiting. You already have a backup path to energy independence.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know when PR-ERF applications are open?

Check the official Puerto Rico Department of Housing website or the designated PR-ERF portal regularly -- at least twice per month. You can also call 211 for updates, visit your local municipal office, or register with community organizations that track enrollment periods and send notifications when new application windows open.

### Can renters apply for free solar programs in Puerto Rico?

Generally, no. PR-ERF is designed for homeowners who own and occupy the property where the system would be installed. However, renters in multi-family buildings may benefit from CDBG-MIT community solar projects that install systems on shared buildings. Check with your municipality for community-level programs that could apply to your situation.

### What documents do I need for a PR-ERF application?

You will typically need a government-issued photo ID, proof of Puerto Rico residency, proof of homeownership (property deed or CRIM tax records), income verification (pay stubs, tax returns, or benefit statements), a recent LUMA Energy bill, and any medical documentation if household members depend on electrically powered medical equipment. Gather these before the application window opens so you can submit immediately.

### Is there a cost to apply for PR-ERF?

No. The PR-ERF application is completely free. If anyone asks you to pay an application fee, processing fee, or any other charge to submit or expedite your application, it is a scam. Report it to local authorities. The only legitimate application channels are the official government portal, municipal offices, and authorized community outreach events.

### Can I apply for PR-ERF if I already have some solar panels?

Typically, no. PR-ERF prioritizes homes that do not currently have any solar energy system. If you have an existing partial installation and need additional panels or battery storage, your eligibility will depend on the specific rules of the current enrollment period. Contact the program administrators directly for guidance on your particular situation.

## Moving Forward: Take Control of Your Energy Future

Free solar programs like PR-ERF and CDBG-MIT represent a genuine opportunity for eligible Puerto Rico homeowners. If you qualify, the benefit is substantial -- a complete solar-plus-battery system at no cost, providing energy resilience in a place where the grid fails regularly.

But government programs are inherently limited by funding, bureaucracy, and capacity. Not everyone who applies will be selected, and the timeline is measured in months, not weeks.

The most effective approach is a dual strategy: apply for every free program you qualify for, and simultaneously explore private options that give you control over your timeline. Whether your solar system comes from PR-ERF or from a $0 down installation through [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com), the end result is the same -- **your own power, on your own roof, ready for whatever comes next**.
