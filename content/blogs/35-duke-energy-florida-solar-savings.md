## Duke Energy Net Metering

Duke Energy offers **full retail net metering** — one of the best policies in the country.

### How It Works

1. Your panels produce electricity during the day
2. Excess energy flows to Duke's grid
3. Duke credits you at the full retail rate
4. Use credits when panels aren't producing
5. Pay only for net usage

### Credit Rollover

- Monthly excess credits roll forward
- Accumulate during sunny spring months
- Use during high-AC summer months
- Annual true-up settles remaining balance

### Interconnection Process

1. **Application:** Submit through Duke's portal
2. **Review:** 10-15 business days typical
3. **Approval:** Receive Permission to Operate
4. **Installation:** Complete system installation
5. **Inspection:** Duke verifies and activates

## Common Questions from Duke Customers

### Will my bill go to zero?

Most customers reduce their bill to the minimum customer charge (~$12/month) plus a small amount for net usage. Complete elimination is rare but significant reduction is typical.

### What if Duke changes net metering?

Florida has protected net metering through legislation. While policy changes are always possible, current customers would likely be grandfathered.

### How long until I see ROI?

Typical Duke Energy customers see:
- **Payback period:** 6-8 years
- **25-year savings:** $35,000-$50,000
- **ROI:** 200-300%

### Can I still go solar with an HOA?

Yes. Florida's Solar Rights Act prevents HOAs from prohibiting solar. They can require approval but cannot deny reasonable installations.

Duke Energy Florida customers are in an excellent position for solar:

- Rising rates make savings more valuable each year
- Net metering at full retail maximizes returns
- Florida incentives reduce upfront costs by 30-40%

With rates projected to continue rising 5-7% annually, locking in solar now protects against decades of increases.
