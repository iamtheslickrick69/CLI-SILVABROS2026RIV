# Solar Financing Options in Puerto Rico: Buy, Lease, or PPA?

**Puerto Rico homeowners can go solar with $0 down through three financing paths: buying with a solar loan, leasing the system, or signing a power purchase agreement (PPA). Each option has different implications for ownership, long-term savings, and eligibility for tax incentives — and the right choice depends on your federal tax situation, budget, and how long you plan to stay in your home.**

---

## Key Takeaways

- **You do not need cash upfront to go solar in Puerto Rico.** All three financing options — purchase, lease, and PPA — offer $0-down structures that can lower your electricity costs from day one.
- **Most Puerto Rico residents cannot claim the federal solar tax credit directly,** because income earned on the island is generally exempt from U.S. federal income tax. This makes lease and PPA models more attractive in PR than on the mainland.
- **Lease and PPA providers can still access federal tax incentives through 2027** under Section 48E, passing those savings through to you as lower monthly payments or per-kWh rates.
- **If you own the system, you benefit most from Puerto Rico's local incentives** — including 100% property tax exemptions on solar equipment and sales tax exemptions on solar purchases under Act 83.
- **There is no one-size-fits-all answer.** The best financing option depends on your income, tax status, roof condition, homeownership timeline, and comfort with long-term contracts.

## Three Ways to Go Solar in Puerto Rico

With average residential electricity rates topping 24 cents per kWh under LUMA Energy — and rate increases proposed for 2026 — the financial case for solar in Puerto Rico is strong. But deciding *how* to finance your system matters almost as much as deciding to go solar in the first place.

Here is a straightforward look at the three primary solar financing options available to homeowners on the island.

### 1. Buying (Cash or Solar Loan)

You purchase the system outright or finance it through a solar loan. You own the panels and battery from day one.

### 2. Leasing

A solar company installs and owns the system on your roof. You pay a fixed monthly lease payment for 20 to 25 years, typically lower than your current LUMA bill.

### 3. Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)

A solar company installs and owns the system. Instead of a fixed lease payment, you pay for the electricity the panels produce at a set per-kWh rate — usually below what LUMA charges.

All three options can be structured with $0 down. The differences come down to ownership, savings potential, tax eligibility, and flexibility.

## Buying Solar in Puerto Rico: Cash or Loan

Purchasing a solar system — whether with cash or through a $0-down solar loan — gives you full ownership from the moment the panels are installed. For homeowners who plan to stay in their home long-term, buying typically delivers the highest total savings over the life of the system.

### How It Works

- **Cash purchase:** You pay the full cost upfront (typically $15,000 to $35,000 for a residential system with battery storage). No monthly payments, no interest.
- **Solar loan:** You finance the system with a $0-down loan, making monthly payments over 10 to 25 years. You own the system from day one, and the loan is secured by the equipment or your home.

### Pros of Buying

- **Highest long-term savings.** Once the loan is paid off, your electricity is essentially free. Cash buyers see immediate return on investment.
- **Full ownership and equity.** The system is yours. It adds value to your property and you control maintenance decisions.
- **Puerto Rico tax benefits apply to you.** Owners benefit directly from the 100% property tax exemption on solar equipment and the sales and use tax exemption on solar purchases under Act 83-2010.
- **No escalator clauses.** Your costs are fixed (loan payment) or eliminated (cash), regardless of what LUMA does to rates.
- **25-year equipment warranties** protect your investment. At RIV Solar, every purchased system comes with a 25-year warranty covering panels, inverters, and workmanship.

### Cons of Buying

- **Higher upfront commitment.** Even with $0-down loans, you are taking on debt and monthly payments that may be higher than a lease or PPA payment initially.
- **You are responsible for maintenance.** Although modern solar systems require minimal upkeep, any repairs or monitoring fall on you (unless covered by warranty).
- **The federal ITC is largely unavailable to PR residents.** This is the most important nuance for buyers on the island. The Section 25D residential solar tax credit expired on December 31, 2025, for all U.S. homeowners. But even before that, most Puerto Rico residents could not claim it because income earned on the island is exempt from federal income tax under Section 933 of the Internal Revenue Code. The only exception: residents who earn U.S.-sourced income (such as federal employees) and file a federal return.

### Who Should Buy?

Buying makes the most sense if you plan to stay in your home for 10 or more years, want to maximize lifetime savings, value full ownership, and are comfortable with a solar loan payment. If you are a federal employee or have U.S.-sourced income, buying may have been the clear winner in the past — though the 25D credit no longer exists for systems installed after 2025.

---

## Leasing Solar in Puerto Rico

A solar lease lets you benefit from solar energy without owning the equipment. The solar company installs, owns, and maintains the system. You pay a fixed monthly fee.

### How It Works

- The installer designs and installs a solar and battery system on your roof at no upfront cost.
- You sign a 20- to 25-year lease agreement with a fixed monthly payment.
- The solar company owns the system, handles maintenance, and monitors performance.
- At the end of the lease, you may have the option to purchase the system, renew the lease, or have the panels removed.

### Pros of Leasing

- **$0 down, predictable payments.** Your monthly lease payment is fixed and typically lower than your current LUMA bill.
- **No maintenance responsibility.** The leasing company owns the system and is responsible for repairs, monitoring, and upkeep.
- **The leasing company can claim federal tax incentives.** Under Section 48E, the commercial ITC remains available through 2027 for solar companies that own the equipment. This is significant in Puerto Rico, where most homeowners cannot claim the credit themselves. The leasing company's tax savings get baked into your lower lease payment.
- **Immediate savings.** If your lease payment is less than your current LUMA bill, you save money from month one.

### Cons of Leasing

- **You do not own the system.** You build no equity. The panels on your roof belong to someone else.
- **Lower total savings than buying.** Over 25 years, a lease will save you less than an owned system because the leasing company needs to earn a return.
- **Escalator clauses are common.** Many leases include an annual escalator (typically 1% to 3%) that increases your payment each year. Make sure you understand whether your lease has one and how it compares to projected LUMA rate increases.
- **Selling your home can be complicated.** The new buyer must agree to assume the lease, which can slow down or complicate a sale.
- **You do not benefit directly from PR tax exemptions.** The property tax and sales tax exemptions under Act 83 benefit the system owner — which is the leasing company, not you.

### Who Should Lease?

Leasing is a reasonable option if you want solar savings without any ownership responsibility, prefer predictable payments, do not qualify for federal tax credits, and are not concerned about maximizing long-term return. It is also worth considering if your roof needs replacement soon — some lease agreements include roof warranty protections.

## Solar PPA in Puerto Rico

A power purchase agreement (PPA) is similar to a lease in that a third party owns the system. The key difference is how you pay: instead of a fixed monthly fee, you pay for the actual electricity the panels produce, measured in kilowatt-hours.

### How It Works

- A solar company installs and owns the system on your roof at $0 upfront cost.
- You sign a 20- to 25-year agreement to purchase the electricity generated at a fixed per-kWh rate.
- That rate is typically set below the current LUMA rate — for example, 18 to 20 cents per kWh compared to LUMA's 24+ cents.
- You pay only for what the system produces. On cloudy months, you pay less. On sunny months, you use more solar and buy less from LUMA.

### Pros of a PPA

- **$0 down and usage-based payments.** You only pay for electricity you actually use from the solar system.
- **Rate is typically below LUMA.** A well-structured PPA locks in a per-kWh rate that is lower than what you would pay LUMA, providing immediate savings.
- **No maintenance responsibility.** Like a lease, the PPA provider handles all system upkeep.
- **The PPA provider claims federal tax incentives** under Section 48E, which can translate into a lower per-kWh rate for you.
- **Transparent pricing.** You can compare your PPA rate directly against LUMA's published rate to see your savings in black and white.

### Cons of a PPA

- **You do not own the system.** Same as a lease — no equity, no direct tax benefits from Act 83.
- **Escalator clauses may apply.** Some PPAs include an annual rate increase. Ask whether the rate is truly fixed or if it escalates, and by how much.
- **Production variability.** Your payment fluctuates with system output. While Puerto Rico's solar resource is excellent (averaging 5 to 6 peak sun hours daily), shading or equipment issues can affect production.
- **Long-term contract.** Exiting a PPA early can involve buyout fees.
- **Home sale complications.** The PPA must transfer to the new homeowner, which requires their agreement.

### Who Should Choose a PPA?

A PPA works well for homeowners who want to pay less per kWh than LUMA charges, prefer a pay-for-what-you-use model, and do not want to deal with system ownership or maintenance. It is especially compelling in Puerto Rico because the PPA provider — not you — captures the federal tax benefit, making the credit accessible to households that could never claim it directly.

## Side-by-Side Comparison: Buy vs. Lease vs. PPA

| Factor | Buy (Cash or Loan) | Lease | PPA |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Upfront cost** | $0 (loan) to full price (cash) | $0 | $0 |
| **Who owns the system** | You | Solar company | Solar company |
| **Monthly payment structure** | Loan payment or none (cash) | Fixed monthly fee | Per-kWh rate for solar electricity |
| **Typical contract length** | Loan: 10-25 years | 20-25 years | 20-25 years |
| **Maintenance responsibility** | You (warranty covers most) | Solar company | Solar company |
| **Federal tax credit (ITC)** | Not available to most PR residents | Provider claims 48E, passes savings to you | Provider claims 48E, passes savings to you |
| **PR property tax exemption** | Yes — direct benefit to you | No — benefits the owner (solar co.) | No — benefits the owner (solar co.) |
| **PR sales tax exemption** | Yes — you save on purchase | N/A (you are not purchasing) | N/A (you are not purchasing) |
| **Total lifetime savings** | Highest | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Home sale impact** | Adds property value | Buyer must assume lease | Buyer must assume PPA |
| **Annual escalator** | None (fixed loan or $0 after payoff) | Often 1-3% annually | Often 1-3% annually |
| **Best for** | Long-term homeowners, max savings | Hassle-free solar, no ownership | Pay-per-use, immediate rate reduction |

## Which Financing Option Is Best for Puerto Rico?

This is where Puerto Rico's unique tax situation makes the decision different from the mainland United States.

### The Federal Tax Credit Reality

On the mainland, buying solar was historically the clear winner because homeowners could claim a 30% federal tax credit under Section 25D, dramatically reducing the cost of ownership. That credit expired on December 31, 2025.

In Puerto Rico, most residents were never eligible for that credit in the first place. Under Section 933 of the Internal Revenue Code, income earned on the island is generally exempt from U.S. federal income tax. No federal tax liability means no credit to claim.

The exception was federal employees (postal workers, TSA, military, FBI) and residents with U.S.-sourced income who filed federal returns. For those households, buying with the ITC was a strong advantage — but that door is now closed for systems installed in 2026 and beyond.

### What This Means in 2026

Now that Section 25D is gone, the federal incentive landscape has leveled:

- **Lease and PPA providers** can still claim the commercial investment tax credit under Section 48E through 2027 (with safe harbor provisions for projects that begin construction by mid-2026). This means the provider captures the 30% credit and factors it into your lower lease payment or PPA rate.
- **Buyers** no longer have any federal credit to claim, regardless of where they live.

For Puerto Rico homeowners, this shift actually makes lease and PPA options relatively more attractive in 2026 than they were before — because the gap between owning (without a credit) and leasing (where the provider captures a credit) has narrowed.

### The Local Incentive Advantage for Buyers

That said, buyers still benefit from Puerto Rico's own incentives:

- **100% property tax exemption** on solar equipment under Act 83-2010
- **Sales and use tax exemption** on solar equipment purchases

These are meaningful savings that only system owners receive. If you plan to own your home for 15 or more years, the combination of no monthly payment after loan payoff, property tax protection, and full equity in the system can still make buying the best long-term financial decision.

### The Bottom Line for Puerto Rico

- **If you want maximum lifetime savings and plan to stay long-term:** Buy with a solar loan.
- **If you want immediate savings with zero responsibility:** A PPA or lease gives you solar benefits without ownership complexity, and the provider's ability to claim 48E works in your favor.
- **If you are unsure about your timeline:** A lease or PPA may be safer because you avoid the long payback commitment of ownership.

## Seven Questions to Ask Before Choosing a Solar Financing Option

Before you sign any solar contract in Puerto Rico, make sure you can answer these questions clearly.

### 1. Do I have federal income tax liability?

If you work for the federal government or earn U.S.-sourced income, your tax situation is different from most island residents. A CPA can confirm whether any federal credits apply to your situation going forward — though the residential credit no longer exists for new installations.

### 2. How long do I plan to stay in this home?

Ownership rewards patience. If you expect to move within 5 to 7 years, a lease or PPA may make more financial sense because you avoid the longer payback period of a purchased system.

### 3. Does the lease or PPA include an escalator clause?

Ask specifically: does my monthly payment or per-kWh rate increase each year? If so, by how much? Compare the escalated rate in year 10 and year 20 against projected LUMA rates to see whether the deal still saves you money long-term.

### 4. What happens if I sell my home?

Understand the transfer process. Can the lease or PPA be assumed by a new buyer? What are the buyout terms if the buyer does not want the system? For purchased systems, understand how solar adds to your home's appraised value.

### 5. Who handles maintenance and monitoring?

With a purchase, confirm what is covered under warranty and for how long. With a lease or PPA, confirm the provider's obligations for repairs, panel cleaning, inverter replacement, and real-time monitoring.

### 6. What is the total cost over the full contract term?

Do not just look at the monthly payment. Calculate the total amount you will pay over 20 or 25 years — including any escalators — and compare that to what you would pay LUMA over the same period, factoring in historical rate increases.

### 7. Does the system include battery storage?

In Puerto Rico, battery backup is not a luxury — it is a necessity. LUMA outages are a reality. Make sure your financing option includes a battery system and that the terms cover battery replacement if needed during the contract period. At RIV Solar, battery storage is included in every system we install, whether purchased, leased, or through a PPA.

## What About Free Solar Programs in Puerto Rico?

You may have heard about the Programa Acceso Solar, a federal initiative through the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund (PR-ERF) designed to provide subsidized solar and battery systems to low-income households. The program originally aimed to serve up to 30,000 homes.

However, in late 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy redirected $365 million of that funding away from residential solar installations and toward broader grid resilience projects. While some installations may still occur through existing commitments, the program's scope has been significantly reduced.

If you were counting on a free government program, the timeline is uncertain. For homeowners who want solar on their own terms and timeline, private financing through a purchase, lease, or PPA remains the most reliable path.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I go solar in Puerto Rico with no money down?

Yes. All three financing options — buying with a solar loan, leasing, and signing a PPA — are available with $0 down in Puerto Rico. Your monthly payment or per-kWh rate depends on the financing structure you choose, but none of them require an upfront investment to get started.

### Do Puerto Rico homeowners qualify for the 30% federal solar tax credit?

Most Puerto Rico residents do not qualify because income earned on the island is generally exempt from U.S. federal income tax under Section 933 of the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, the residential solar tax credit (Section 25D) expired on December 31, 2025. However, lease and PPA providers can still claim the commercial credit under Section 48E through 2027, passing savings to you through lower rates.

### What is the difference between a solar lease and a solar PPA?

With a lease, you pay a fixed monthly fee to use a solar system installed on your roof, regardless of how much electricity it produces. With a PPA, you pay a set price per kilowatt-hour only for the electricity the system actually generates. Both involve third-party ownership and $0 down, but the payment structure differs. PPAs tend to align your costs more closely with actual solar production.

### Is it better to buy or lease solar panels in Puerto Rico?

It depends on your financial situation and timeline. Buying delivers higher total savings over 25 years and gives you property tax and sales tax exemptions under Puerto Rico's Act 83. Leasing offers lower risk, no maintenance responsibility, and the leasing company can capture federal tax incentives that most PR residents cannot claim directly. If you plan to stay in your home long-term, buying usually wins on total return.

### What happens to my solar lease or PPA if I sell my house?

The lease or PPA contract typically transfers to the new homeowner, who must agree to assume the remaining terms. Some agreements include a buyout option that allows you to purchase the system and include it in the home sale. It is important to review the transfer and buyout clauses in your contract before listing your home. Purchased systems simply transfer with the property and can increase its resale value.
