# Solar Lease vs Buy: Which Is Best for California Homeowners?

**The short answer: Buying (with cash or a loan) is almost always better than leasing for California homeowners who can use the 30% tax credit.** Purchasing your solar system means you own the equipment, capture all incentives, and maximize long-term savings. Leasing makes sense only in specific situations where ownership isn't practical. Here's the complete comparison.

## Understanding Your Options

### Option 1: Cash Purchase
Pay the full system cost upfront.

**Pros:**
- Lowest total cost
- Immediate full savings
- No interest payments
- Maximum ROI

**Cons:**
- Requires $15,000-35,000 upfront
- Opportunity cost (money tied up)

**Best for:** Those with available funds who want maximum long-term savings.

### Option 2: Solar Loan
Finance the system and pay over time.

**Pros:**
- $0 down options available
- Own the system immediately
- Keep the 30% tax credit
- Monthly payment often < current electric bill

**Cons:**
- Interest adds to total cost
- Credit approval required

**Best for:** Most homeowners—best balance of accessibility and savings.

### Option 3: Lease
Rent the system from a solar company.

**Pros:**
- $0 down
- No maintenance worries
- Fixed monthly payment

**Cons:**
- Don't own the system
- Don't get the tax credit
- Lower total savings
- Contract complications when selling home
- Escalators may increase payments

**Best for:** Those who can't use the tax credit (low tax liability, non-profits, etc.).

## The Numbers: A Real Comparison

Let's compare all three options for the same home:

### The Scenario:
- **Current electric bill:** $350/month
- **System needed:** 9 kW
- **System cost:** $31,500

### Option 1: Cash Purchase

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| System cost | $31,500 |
| 30% tax credit | -$9,450 |
| **Net cost** | **$22,050** |
| Annual savings | $4,200 |
| Payback | 5.3 years |
| **25-year savings** | **$125,000+** |

### Option 2: Solar Loan (25-year, 6.5% APR)

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Loan amount | $31,500 |
| Tax credit (use to pay down loan) | -$9,450 |
| Effective loan | $22,050 |
| Monthly payment | $150 |
| Monthly savings vs. $350 bill | $200 |
| Total interest paid | ~$14,000 |
| Total cost | ~$36,000 |
| **25-year savings** | **$95,000+** |

### Option 3: Lease ($150/month)

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Monthly payment | $150 |
| Monthly savings vs. $350 bill | $200 |
| Annual escalator | 2.9% |
| Year 10 payment | ~$200/month |
| Year 20 payment | ~$265/month |
| Total paid over 25 years | ~$60,000 |
| **25-year savings** | **$45,000** |

### Summary Comparison:

| Metric | Cash | Loan | Lease |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| Net cost | $22,050 | $36,000 | $60,000 |
| 25-year savings | $125,000+ | $95,000+ | $45,000 |
| You own system | Yes | Yes | No |
| Tax credit benefit | Yes | Yes | No |

**Buying beats leasing by $50,000-80,000 over 25 years.**

## The Tax Credit Difference

This is the biggest factor. The 30% federal tax credit is worth $6,000-$12,000 on typical systems.

### When You Buy:
You claim the credit on your taxes. On a $30,000 system, that's **$9,000 back**.

### When You Lease:
The leasing company owns the system, so they claim the credit. They may pass some benefit through lower lease payments, but you don't get the full value.

### Do You Qualify for the Tax Credit?

You can use the credit if you:
- Have federal income tax liability
- Will owe at least the credit amount over 1-2 years
- Own the system (purchase, not lease)

**Example:** If you owe $7,000 in federal taxes and have a $9,000 credit:
- Year 1: Credit reduces taxes to $0 (uses $7,000)
- Year 2: Remaining $2,000 credit rolls forward

If you have low or no federal tax liability (retired, low income, etc.), you can't fully use the credit—making leasing relatively more attractive.

## The Home Sale Complication

What happens when you sell your house?

### If You Own (Cash or Loan):
- **Owned outright:** System conveys with home, adds to sale price
- **With remaining loan:** Pay off loan from proceeds, or buyer assumes
- **Impact:** Studies show 4-6% higher sale price for solar homes

### If You Lease:
- **Lease transfer:** Buyer must qualify and agree to assume lease
- **Lease buyout:** You pay remaining lease balance to convey free and clear
- **Potential problem:** Some buyers won't take on someone else's lease

**Reality check:** Lease transfers can complicate or delay home sales. Some buyers walk away rather than assume a 15-year lease obligation.

---

## Lease Escalators: The Hidden Cost

Many leases include annual payment escalators—small percentage increases each year.

### Example: 2.9% Annual Escalator

| Year | Monthly Payment |
|------|-----------------|
| 1 | $150 |
| 5 | $169 |
| 10 | $196 |
| 15 | $227 |
| 20 | $263 |
| 25 | $305 |

That $150 payment becomes $305 by year 25. Meanwhile, your locked-in loan payment stays $150.

### The Math Over 25 Years:

| Payment Type | Total Paid |
|--------------|-----------|
| Fixed loan payment ($150/mo) | $45,000 |
| Lease with 2.9% escalator | $62,000 |

**Escalators cost you an extra $17,000** over the lease term.

**Pro tip:** If you lease, negotiate for 0% escalator or cap it at 1%.

## Maintenance: Is It Really Free with Leasing?

Leases tout "maintenance included." But what does that actually cover?

### What Leases Typically Cover:
- Inverter replacement
- Panel repairs
- Monitoring system
- System performance guarantees

### What Ownership Warranties Also Cover:
- 25-year panel performance warranty
- 12-25 year inverter warranty (depending on type)
- Workmanship warranties

### Reality Check:
Solar systems require almost no maintenance. Panels have no moving parts. Inverters occasionally fail (covered by warranty). There's very little that goes wrong.

**The "free maintenance" benefit is worth maybe $500-1,000 over 25 years.** You're paying far more than that in reduced savings by leasing.

## When Leasing Actually Makes Sense

Leasing isn't always wrong. It makes sense when:

### 1. You Can't Use the Tax Credit
If you have little or no federal tax liability (retired, low income, non-profit), you can't benefit from the 30% credit anyway. Leasing becomes relatively more competitive.

### 2. You Can't Qualify for Financing
If credit issues prevent loan approval, leasing may be your only $0-down option.

### 3. You're Selling Soon
If you're definitely moving in 2-3 years and don't want ownership complexity, a short-term lease might work—though buying still often makes sense given home value increases.

### 4. Your Roof Has Issues
If your roof might need replacement during the lease term, having the leasing company handle panel removal/reinstallation could be valuable.

## Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs): A Lease Variation

PPAs are similar to leases but structured differently:

### Lease:
Fixed monthly payment regardless of production.

### PPA:
Pay per kWh the system produces (typically 15-20¢/kWh).

### PPA Considerations:
- **Pros:** Only pay for what you produce; lower bill if system underperforms
- **Cons:** Still don't own system; still don't get tax credit; may have escalators
- **Best for:** Similar situations as leasing

---

## Making Your Decision

### Choose Cash Purchase If:
- You have available funds
- You want maximum long-term savings
- You want full control and ownership

### Choose Solar Loan If:
- You want to own the system
- You can use the 30% tax credit
- You want low or no upfront cost
- You have reasonable credit

### Choose Lease/PPA If:
- You can't use the tax credit
- You can't qualify for financing
- You're okay with significantly lower lifetime savings
- You want zero responsibility for the system

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Buying saves $50,000-80,000+ more** than leasing over 25 years
- **The 30% tax credit** is worth $7,000-12,000—only available to owners
- **Lease escalators** can double your payment over 25 years
- **Home sales are easier** when you own vs. lease
- **Maintenance is minimal**—warranties cover most issues regardless
- **Leasing makes sense** primarily when you can't use the tax credit

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it better to buy solar with cash or finance?
Cash provides the best ROI, but financing lets you go solar without large upfront cost. With financing, you start saving immediately while owning the system.

### What's a good interest rate for a solar loan?
In 2026, rates of 5-8% are typical. Rates under 6% are good; over 8% starts to impact savings. Compare multiple lenders.

### Can I buy out my lease early?
Usually yes, but buyout terms vary. Some contracts make early buyout expensive. Review your specific contract terms.

### Do leased panels affect home appraisal?
Appraisers may not give full value credit for leased systems because the equipment isn't owned. Owned systems clearly add value.

### What happens to a lease if the solar company goes bankrupt?
Your contract would typically transfer to another servicer, but it can create complications. With ownership, you just own the equipment outright.

### Can I negotiate lease terms?
Yes. Negotiate: lower monthly payment, 0% escalator, favorable buyout terms, and easy transfer provisions. Everything is negotiable.
