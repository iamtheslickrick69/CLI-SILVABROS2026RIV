# How Many Solar Panels Do I Need for My Home?

**The short answer: Most California homes need 15-25 solar panels, covering 300-500 square feet of roof space.** The exact number depends on your electricity usage, panel wattage, roof orientation, and whether you're planning for future needs like an EV. Here's how to calculate your specific requirements.

## Quick Sizing Guide

| Monthly Electric Bill | System Size | Number of Panels* |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| $100-150 | 4-5 kW | 10-13 |
| $150-200 | 5-6 kW | 13-15 |
| $200-300 | 6-8 kW | 15-20 |
| $300-400 | 8-10 kW | 20-25 |
| $400-500 | 10-12 kW | 25-30 |
| $500-700 | 12-16 kW | 30-40 |
| $700+ | 16-20 kW | 40-50 |

*Based on 400W panels. Higher wattage panels = fewer needed.

## The Three-Step Sizing Formula

### Step 1: Determine Your Annual Electricity Usage

**Option A: Check your utility bill**
Look for "Total kWh" or "Annual Usage." Add up 12 months.

**Option B: Use your bill amount**
Divide your annual bill by your average rate:
- PG&E: Divide by $0.45
- SCE: Divide by $0.42
- SDG&E: Divide by $0.55

Example: $3,600/year ÷ $0.45 = **8,000 kWh annual usage**

### Step 2: Calculate System Size Needed

In California, 1 kW of solar produces approximately 1,400-1,600 kWh per year (varies by location and roof orientation).

**Formula:**
```
System Size (kW) = Annual Usage (kWh) ÷ 1,500
```

Example: 8,000 kWh ÷ 1,500 = **5.3 kW system**

### Step 3: Calculate Number of Panels

Divide system size by panel wattage:

| Panel Wattage | Panels for 5.3 kW |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 350W | 15.2 → 16 panels |
| 400W | 13.3 → 14 panels |
| 450W | 11.8 → 12 panels |

**Example result:** A home using 8,000 kWh/year needs approximately **12-16 panels** depending on panel wattage.

## Factors That Affect Panel Count

### 1. Panel Wattage (Efficiency)

Modern panels range from 350W to 480W:

| Panel Type | Wattage | Panels for 8 kW |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| Standard | 350-370W | 22-23 |
| High-efficiency | 400-420W | 19-20 |
| Premium | 440-480W | 17-18 |

**Higher wattage = fewer panels needed** (but usually higher cost per panel)

### 2. Roof Orientation

Your roof's direction affects how much each panel produces:

| Orientation | Production | Panels Needed |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| South-facing | 100% | Baseline |
| Southwest | 95% | +5% more |
| West | 88% | +14% more |
| Southeast | 93% | +7% more |
| East | 85% | +18% more |
| North | 55-65% | +50%+ more (often impractical) |

Example: If you need 16 panels with south-facing, you'd need about 19 panels facing west.

### 3. Roof Pitch (Angle)

Optimal pitch in California is 15-35 degrees:

| Pitch | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| 15-35° | Optimal (100%) |
| 0° (flat) | 90-95% (tilt mounts help) |
| 35-45° | 95-98% |
| 45°+ | 90-95% |

Most roofs fall within acceptable ranges. Flat roofs use tilt mounts to optimize angle.

### 4. Shading

Trees, chimneys, and neighboring buildings reduce production:

| Shading Level | Production Loss | Extra Panels Needed |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| None | 0% | None |
| Minor (morning/evening only) | 5-10% | 1-2 |
| Moderate | 15-25% | 3-5 |
| Heavy | 30%+ | May be impractical |

Microinverters help mitigate shading—if one panel is shaded, others continue producing normally.

### 5. Future Usage Plans

Size for where you're going, not just where you are:

| Future Addition | Extra kWh/Year | Extra Panels |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Electric vehicle | 3,000-4,500 | 6-10 |
| Heat pump (replacing gas) | 2,000-3,500 | 4-7 |
| Hot tub | 2,400-3,600 | 5-7 |
| Pool pump | 2,000-4,000 | 4-8 |
| Home office (full-time) | 500-1,000 | 1-2 |
| ADU/addition | 3,000-6,000 | 6-12 |

**Pro tip:** It's cheaper to install extra panels now than to expand later.

## Roof Space Requirements

### Space Per Panel:
- Standard panel: ~18 sq ft (roughly 3.5' × 5.5')
- Including spacing: ~21-22 sq ft per panel

### Total Space Examples:

| System Size | Panels | Roof Space Needed |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| 5 kW | 12-14 | 250-310 sq ft |
| 8 kW | 18-22 | 380-490 sq ft |
| 10 kW | 23-27 | 490-600 sq ft |
| 12 kW | 28-32 | 590-710 sq ft |

### Usable Roof Space:

Not all roof space is usable:
- Setback from edges: 3 feet typically required
- Around vents/skylights: 1-3 feet clearance
- Around HVAC equipment: Clearance required
- Fire pathways: Required in some jurisdictions

**Rule of thumb:** About 60-70% of total roof area is typically usable for solar.

### Don't Have Enough Roof Space?

Options if roof space is limited:
1. **Higher efficiency panels** (more watts per sq ft)
2. **Ground-mounted system** (if yard space available)
3. **Carport/patio cover mount**
4. **Partial offset** (cover most of usage, not all)

## Panel Count by Home Size

While usage matters more than square footage, here are typical ranges:

| Home Size | Typical Usage | Panel Count |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 1,000-1,500 sq ft | 4,000-7,000 kWh | 8-15 |
| 1,500-2,000 sq ft | 6,000-9,000 kWh | 12-20 |
| 2,000-2,500 sq ft | 8,000-12,000 kWh | 16-26 |
| 2,500-3,000 sq ft | 10,000-15,000 kWh | 20-32 |
| 3,000-4,000 sq ft | 12,000-20,000 kWh | 24-42 |
| 4,000+ sq ft | 15,000-30,000 kWh | 32-60+ |

**Warning:** Square footage is a rough guide. A 2,000 sq ft home with a pool and EV uses far more than a similar home without.

## NEM 3.0 Sizing Considerations

Under California's NEM 3.0, system sizing strategy has evolved:

### Old Approach (NEM 2.0):
Oversize slightly → Export excess → Receive near-retail credits

### New Approach (NEM 3.0):
Right-size for self-consumption → Add battery → Minimize exports

### Practical Impact:

| Scenario | NEM 2.0 Approach | NEM 3.0 Approach |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| 8,000 kWh usage | 6-6.5 kW system | 5.5-6 kW + battery |
| Goal | 110% offset | 100% offset + storage |
| Export strategy | Maximize credits | Minimize exports |

**Result:** You might need slightly fewer panels under NEM 3.0, but you'll add battery storage.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Small Efficient Home

**Profile:**
- 1,400 sq ft townhome
- $180/month electric bill
- South-facing roof
- No EV planned

**Calculation:**
- Annual usage: ~5,100 kWh
- System size: 5,100 ÷ 1,500 = 3.4 kW
- With buffer: 4 kW
- **Panels needed: 10-11** (at 380W)

### Example 2: Typical Family Home

**Profile:**
- 2,200 sq ft home
- $320/month electric bill
- Southwest-facing roof
- EV purchase planned next year

**Calculation:**
- Current annual usage: ~8,500 kWh
- Future EV usage: +3,500 kWh
- Total: 12,000 kWh
- System size: 12,000 ÷ 1,500 = 8 kW
- Orientation adjustment (+5%): 8.4 kW
- **Panels needed: 20-22** (at 400W)

### Example 3: Large Home with Pool

**Profile:**
- 3,500 sq ft home
- $580/month electric bill
- West-facing roof (primary)
- Pool pump, hot tub, two EVs planned

**Calculation:**
- Current annual usage: ~14,000 kWh
- Future EVs: +7,000 kWh
- Total: 21,000 kWh
- System size: 21,000 ÷ 1,500 = 14 kW
- Orientation adjustment (+14%): 16 kW
- **Panels needed: 36-40** (at 420W)

## What Size Panels Should You Choose?

### Standard Panels (350-370W)
- **Cost:** Lower per panel
- **Space:** More panels needed
- **Best for:** Large roofs, budget-conscious

### High-Efficiency (400-420W)
- **Cost:** Moderate
- **Space:** Good balance
- **Best for:** Most installations

### Premium (440-480W)
- **Cost:** Higher per panel
- **Space:** Fewest panels needed
- **Best for:** Limited roof space, aesthetics priority

**Our recommendation:** 400-420W panels offer the best balance of efficiency, cost, and availability.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many panels to completely eliminate my bill?
Enough to produce your annual usage. Use the formula: Annual kWh ÷ 1,500 = kW needed. Divide kW by panel wattage for count.

### Can I add more panels later?
Yes, but it's more expensive. Adding panels requires new permits, potential inverter upgrade, and separate labor costs. Better to size correctly upfront.

### What if my roof can't fit enough panels?
Options: higher-efficiency panels, ground mount, carport mount, or partial offset (covering 70-80% of usage still provides significant savings).

### Do all my panels need to face the same direction?
No. Modern systems with microinverters or optimizers can handle multiple roof faces efficiently. Your installer will design for optimal production.

### How many panels do I need for a Tesla/EV?
Roughly 6-10 additional panels (2.5-4 kW) depending on your driving. Average EV adds 3,000-4,500 kWh/year.

### Do panel counts include a battery?
No. Batteries store energy but don't produce it. Panel count is determined by energy needs; battery size is determined by storage needs.
