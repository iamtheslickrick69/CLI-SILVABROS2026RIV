# Tesla Powerwall vs. Enphase vs. Franklin: Best Batteries for Puerto Rico

**There is no single "best" solar battery for every Puerto Rico home. Tesla Powerwall delivers the highest continuous power for whole-home backup, Enphase offers unmatched modularity for smaller or phased installations, and Franklin WH provides the longest-lasting LFP chemistry with robust outdoor durability. The right choice depends on your home's energy load, budget, and how you plan to scale your system over time.**

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Battery backup is not optional in Puerto Rico** — LUMA documented over 90 grid events during summer 2025 alone, and the island still faces chronic generation shortages heading into 2026.
- **Tesla Powerwall 3** leads in raw power output (11.5 kW continuous), making it the strongest single-unit option for whole-home backup during extended outages.
- **Enphase IQ Battery 5P** is the most flexible choice if you already use Enphase microinverters or want to start small and add capacity over time without replacing equipment.
- **Franklin WH** uses Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) chemistry for superior thermal stability and cycle life — a meaningful advantage in Puerto Rico's tropical climate.
- **All three batteries qualify for the 30% federal tax credit**, and RIV Solar installs all three brands so you can choose based on your home's actual needs rather than installer bias.

## Why Your Battery Choice Matters More in Puerto Rico Than Anywhere Else

Puerto Rico's electrical grid is unlike any other in the United States. LUMA Energy's own Resource Adequacy Report acknowledged that a lack of reliable generation capacity would "pose ongoing threats to service reliability" through 2025 and beyond. That projection proved accurate: the grid experienced 93 recorded outage events by the end of summer 2025 — exceeding LUMA's own forecast of 75 events.

The numbers tell a stark story. LUMA projected 154 hours of power outages between June 2024 and June 2025. Add hurricane season, aging transmission infrastructure, and rising electricity costs, and you understand why roughly 83% of the island's rooftop solar systems now include battery storage.

A solar battery in Puerto Rico is not a luxury or a hedge against future rate increases. It is the difference between keeping your refrigerator running, your medical equipment operating, and your family comfortable — or sitting in the dark waiting for a grid that may not come back for hours or days.

That makes choosing the right battery critically important. Each of the three leading residential options — Tesla Powerwall, Enphase IQ Battery, and Franklin WH — takes a fundamentally different approach to home energy storage. Understanding those differences in the context of Puerto Rico's climate, grid conditions, and energy costs will help you make a decision that serves your family for the next 10 to 15 years.

## Tesla Powerwall 3: The Power Leader

### Overview

The Tesla Powerwall 3 is the most recognized name in residential batteries, and its latest generation delivers genuinely impressive hardware. Each unit stores 13.5 kWh of usable energy and provides 11.5 kW of continuous AC power — more than double what competing single units offer. It also integrates a solar inverter capable of handling up to 20 kW of DC solar input, which can simplify system design and reduce component count.

### Key Specifications

- **Usable capacity:** 13.5 kWh
- **Continuous power output:** 11.5 kW AC
- **Solar inverter:** Integrated, up to 20 kW DC input
- **Chemistry:** Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC)
- **Operating temperature:** -4 degF to 122 degF
- **Warranty:** 10 years
- **Scalability:** Up to 3 expansion packs (54 kWh total per system)
- **Installed price (before incentives):** Approximately $14,000 - $16,500

### Why It Works in Puerto Rico

The Powerwall 3's 11.5 kW of continuous power means a single unit can run central air conditioning, a refrigerator, lighting, and several other circuits simultaneously — without the load-shedding compromises smaller batteries require. For larger homes or families that refuse to sacrifice comfort during outages, this is a significant advantage.

The Tesla app provides real-time monitoring, Storm Watch (which automatically charges the battery ahead of severe weather), and time-of-use optimization. Storm Watch is particularly relevant during Puerto Rico's June-through-November hurricane season.

### Considerations for PR Homeowners

Tesla uses NMC chemistry rather than LFP, which means slightly higher energy density but a shorter expected cycle life compared to LFP alternatives. The 10-year warranty is the shortest among the three brands reviewed here. Additionally, Tesla availability in Puerto Rico can fluctuate, and the company controls its own installer network and pricing more tightly than other manufacturers.

## Enphase IQ Battery 5P: The Modular Strategist

### Overview

Enphase takes a fundamentally different approach. Rather than a single large battery, the IQ Battery 5P is a compact, wall-mounted module containing 5.0 kWh of usable storage and six embedded microinverters. You install the number of units your home needs — one, two, four, or more — and the system scales seamlessly.

### Key Specifications

- **Usable capacity:** 5.0 kWh per unit
- **Continuous power output:** 3.84 kW per unit
- **Peak power output:** 7.68 kW per unit (3 seconds)
- **Chemistry:** Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP)
- **Warranty:** 15 years / 6,000 cycles
- **Scalability:** Stack multiple units to reach desired capacity
- **Requires:** IQ System Controller 3 for backup functionality
- **Installed price (before incentives):** Approximately $15,000 - $17,000 for two units (10 kWh)

### Why It Works in Puerto Rico

For homeowners who already have or plan to install Enphase microinverters on their solar panels, the IQ Battery 5P creates a fully unified system. Every component — panels, microinverters, batteries, monitoring — operates within the Enphase ecosystem and is managed through a single app. This simplicity reduces potential points of failure and makes troubleshooting straightforward.

The modular design also allows phased investment. You can start with one or two units to cover essential loads and add more batteries later as your budget allows — without replacing any existing equipment. In a market where many homeowners are financing their solar systems with $0-down plans, this flexibility is genuinely useful.

Enphase's LFP chemistry provides better thermal stability than NMC, which matters in Puerto Rico's heat and humidity. The 15-year warranty and 6,000-cycle rating offer long-term peace of mind.

### Considerations for PR Homeowners

The trade-off is power density. A single 5 kWh Enphase unit only delivers 3.84 kW continuous, which is not enough to run a central air conditioner on its own. To match the Tesla Powerwall 3's capacity and output, you would need three IQ Battery 5P units (15 kWh, 11.52 kW) — and three units typically cost more than a single Powerwall.

Additionally, the Enphase system requires the IQ System Controller 3 for any backup functionality, adding another component and cost to the installation.

## Franklin WH: The Resilience Specialist

### Overview

Franklin WH (Whole Home) may be the least familiar name of the three, but it has earned a strong reputation among installers for its whole-home backup capability, durable LFP chemistry, and flexible system architecture. The Franklin system consists of two core components: the **aGate** (an intelligent control panel that manages solar, grid, battery, and generator inputs) and the **aPower** battery modules.

### Key Specifications (aPower)

- **Usable capacity:** 13.6 kWh per unit
- **Continuous power output:** 5 kW per unit
- **Peak power output:** 10 kW per unit
- **Chemistry:** Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP)
- **Round-trip efficiency:** 89%
- **Warranty:** 12 years / 43 MWh throughput
- **Scalability:** Up to 15 aPower units per aGate (204 kWh)
- **Noise level:** Less than 30 dB (whisper-quiet)
- **Installed price (before incentives):** Approximately $15,000 - $17,500 for aGate + one aPower

*Note: Franklin WH has also released the aPower 2, which offers 15 kWh capacity, 10 kW continuous output, and an extended 15-year warranty. Ask your installer about current availability in Puerto Rico.*

### Why It Works in Puerto Rico

Franklin WH was designed from the ground up for whole-home backup, and it shows. The aGate serves as the brains of the system, managing power flow between your solar panels, the grid, the battery, and even a backup generator — all automatically. For Puerto Rico homeowners who own a generator for extended outages, this integration is a standout feature that neither Tesla nor Enphase offers as elegantly.

The LFP chemistry handles Puerto Rico's heat better than NMC alternatives, and the passive cooling design (no fans) means fewer mechanical parts to fail in a humid, salt-air environment. The system is rated for outdoor installation, which matters when indoor wall space is limited.

Franklin's scalability is also exceptional. You can add battery modules over time, and the aGate supports up to 204 kWh of total storage — far beyond what most residential installations need, but valuable for larger properties or homes with especially high energy consumption.

### Considerations for PR Homeowners

The aPower's 5 kW continuous output per unit is lower than the Tesla Powerwall 3's 11.5 kW. For whole-home backup with high-draw appliances like central AC, you may need two aPower units to match the Powerwall's power output. The 12-year warranty on the original aPower, while solid, is shorter than Enphase's 15-year coverage. Franklin WH is also newer to the Puerto Rico market, so availability may vary by installer.

## Cost Comparison: What You Will Actually Pay in Puerto Rico

Battery pricing in Puerto Rico differs from mainland U.S. quotes due to shipping costs, local labor rates, and permitting requirements. Here is a realistic breakdown.

### Estimated Total Installed Costs (One Battery System)

| System | Estimated Installed Cost | After 30% Federal ITC |
|---|---|---|
| Tesla Powerwall 3 (13.5 kWh) | $14,000 - $16,500 | $9,800 - $11,550 |
| Enphase IQ 5P x2 (10 kWh) | $15,000 - $17,000 | $10,500 - $11,900 |
| Enphase IQ 5P x3 (15 kWh) | $20,000 - $23,000 | $14,000 - $16,100 |
| Franklin WH aGate + aPower (13.6 kWh) | $15,000 - $17,500 | $10,500 - $12,250 |

### Important Cost Factors

**Federal tax credit:** All three systems qualify for the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) when installed with a solar panel system. This is a dollar-for-dollar credit on your federal taxes — not a deduction.

**Puerto Rico incentives:** Puerto Rico's own solar tax exemptions can further reduce costs. Property tax exemptions on solar equipment and sales tax exemptions (Act 83) apply to battery storage systems installed alongside solar panels.

**Cost per kWh stored:** When comparing value, look at installed cost per kWh of usable storage. Tesla typically offers the lowest cost per kWh for a single large battery, while Enphase's per-kWh cost decreases as you add more units.

**Financing:** Programs offering $0-down solar and battery financing make all three options accessible without large upfront payments. Monthly payments on a financed system are often lower than current LUMA electricity bills.

## How to Decide: A Practical Framework

Choosing between these three batteries does not have to be overwhelming. Work through these questions:

**1. What is your primary goal?**
If you want to power your entire home — including central AC — through a multi-hour outage, you need high continuous power output. Tesla Powerwall 3 delivers this most efficiently from a single unit.

**2. What solar equipment do you already have (or plan to install)?**
If you are building an all-Enphase system with microinverters, adding Enphase batteries keeps everything on one platform. If you are starting from scratch, all three options work with various solar panel and inverter configurations.

**3. Do you own a backup generator?**
If yes, Franklin WH's aGate is the only system that natively manages solar, battery, grid, and generator inputs through a single control panel.

**4. How important is long-term durability in tropical conditions?**
LFP batteries (Enphase and Franklin WH) handle heat and humidity better than NMC (Tesla) and typically last more charge cycles. In Puerto Rico's climate, this is a meaningful consideration.

**5. What is your budget and timeline?**
If you want to start smaller and grow, Enphase's modular approach lets you invest incrementally. Tesla and Franklin WH require a larger initial investment but deliver more capacity per unit.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which solar battery lasts the longest in Puerto Rico's climate?

Batteries using Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) chemistry — Enphase IQ Battery 5P and Franklin WH — generally last longer in hot climates than Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) batteries like the Tesla Powerwall. LFP batteries tolerate higher temperatures with less degradation and offer more charge-discharge cycles over their lifespan, making them well-suited for Puerto Rico's tropical environment.

### Can one Tesla Powerwall power a whole house during a LUMA outage?

A single Tesla Powerwall 3 can power most homes during an outage thanks to its 11.5 kW continuous output and 13.5 kWh capacity. It can typically run central air conditioning, a refrigerator, lights, and essential electronics simultaneously. However, the duration of backup depends on your total energy consumption — homes with very high loads may need a second unit for extended outages.

### Is Enphase or Tesla Powerwall better for Puerto Rico?

It depends on your priorities. Tesla Powerwall delivers more power from a single unit, making it better for whole-home backup with heavy loads. Enphase is better if you want modular scalability, a longer warranty (15 years vs. 10), and LFP chemistry that performs better in tropical heat. If you already have Enphase microinverters, staying within the Enphase ecosystem simplifies your system.

### How much does a solar battery system cost in Puerto Rico after incentives?

A single-battery solar storage system in Puerto Rico typically costs between $14,000 and $17,500 before incentives. After the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit, the net cost drops to approximately $9,800 to $12,250. Additional Puerto Rico tax exemptions on solar equipment can reduce the effective cost further. Financing options with $0 down are available through qualified installers like RIV Solar.

### Can Franklin WH batteries work with a backup generator?

Yes. Franklin WH's aGate control panel is specifically designed to manage multiple power sources — solar panels, battery storage, the utility grid, and a backup generator — automatically. During an extended outage, the system can use your generator to recharge the batteries and manage load distribution without manual intervention. This generator integration is a key differentiator that Tesla and Enphase do not offer as seamlessly.
