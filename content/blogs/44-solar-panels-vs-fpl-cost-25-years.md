# Solar Panels vs. FPL: Which Costs More Over 25 Years?

**Over 25 years, the average Florida homeowner will pay FPL between $65,000 and $110,000 or more for electricity — and that number keeps rising. A solar panel system, by contrast, typically costs $15,000 to $25,000 after the 30% federal tax credit, pays for itself in 5 to 8 years, and then generates nearly free electricity for the remaining 15 to 20 years. The math is not close.**

---

## Key Takeaways

- **FPL electricity costs compound relentlessly** — with 3% to 5% annual rate increases, a $180/month bill today could exceed $400/month within 25 years, totaling $65,000 to $110,000+ paid to the utility.
- **A solar panel system is a one-time investment** that typically costs $15,000 to $25,000 after the 30% federal tax credit, with $0-down financing options that can match or beat your current electric bill from day one.
- **Most Florida homeowners hit their solar breakeven point in 5 to 8 years**, after which every kilowatt-hour produced is essentially free electricity for the remaining life of the system.
- **After your solar system is paid off, you keep the savings** — homeowners commonly save $40,000 to $80,000+ over the full 25-year system lifespan compared to staying on FPL.
- **Florida's solar incentives are among the strongest in the country**, including the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit, 100% sales tax exemption on solar equipment, 100% property tax exemption on added home value, and full retail-rate net metering credits.

## The True Cost of FPL Electricity Over 25 Years

Most people think about their electric bill in monthly terms. That is exactly how utility companies want you to think. When you zoom out to a 25-year window — the standard lifespan of a solar panel system — the numbers become staggering.

Let us start with where Florida homeowners stand right now.

### What Florida Homeowners Pay Today

The average residential electricity bill in Florida ranges from **$150 to $250 per month**, depending on home size, usage habits, and whether you are running the air conditioning year-round (which, in Florida, most people are). FPL's residential rate currently sits around **$0.13 to $0.15 per kilowatt-hour** when you factor in all surcharges, fuel costs, and base charges.

For a household using 1,200 kWh per month — which is typical in Florida — that translates to roughly **$175 to $200 per month** before taxes and fees.

That sounds manageable in isolation. But electricity is not a one-time purchase. It is a subscription you never stop paying, and the price only goes in one direction.

### The Cumulative Cost Without Solar

If your FPL bill averages $190 per month and never increases (which it will — more on that in a moment), you would pay:

- **$2,280 per year**
- **$22,800 over 10 years**
- **$57,000 over 25 years**

That is the *floor*. That is the absolute minimum assuming rates freeze exactly where they are today, which has never happened in the history of Florida electricity pricing.

## FPL Rate Increase Projections: The Number They Hope You Ignore

FPL and other Florida utilities have raised rates consistently over the past two decades. Historical data shows an average annual increase of **3% to 5%**, with some years spiking much higher due to fuel cost adjustments, infrastructure surcharges, and storm recovery fees.

### How Compounding Rate Increases Change the Math

Here is what happens when you apply even a conservative 4% annual increase to a $190/month starting bill:

| Year | Monthly Bill | Annual Cost | Cumulative Total |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | $190 | $2,280 | $2,280 |
| 5 | $231 | $2,772 | $12,498 |
| 10 | $281 | $3,372 | $27,396 |
| 15 | $342 | $4,104 | $45,108 |
| 20 | $416 | $4,992 | $67,068 |
| 25 | $507 | $6,084 | $94,740 |

Read that last line again. At a 4% annual increase — which is right in the middle of the historical range — you are looking at paying **over $500 per month** for electricity in year 25. Your cumulative total approaches **$95,000**.

If you are in a larger home with a starting bill of $250/month, the 25-year total at 4% annual increases climbs past **$120,000**.

These are not scare tactics. These are the numbers that FPL's own historical rate data supports. And you have zero control over any of it. Every year, the utility decides how much more you pay, and you write the check.

### Storm Recovery Surcharges: Florida's Hidden Cost

Florida homeowners face an additional cost that residents of most other states do not: **hurricane recovery surcharges**. After major storms, FPL and other utilities pass rebuilding costs directly to customers through multi-year surcharges on every bill. After the 2004-2005 hurricane seasons, these surcharges lasted for years. After Hurricane Ian in 2022, the pattern repeated.

You pay to rebuild their infrastructure. Every time.

## The True Cost of Going Solar in Florida

Now let us look at the other side of the ledger.

### System Cost Before Incentives

A typical residential solar panel system in Florida — sized to offset most or all of a household's electricity usage — runs between **$22,000 and $36,000 before incentives**, depending on system size, equipment selection, and installation complexity.

For an average Florida home needing an 8 to 10 kW system, the pre-incentive cost typically falls in the **$25,000 to $32,000 range**.

### The 30% Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)

The federal government currently offers a **30% tax credit** on the total cost of your solar installation, including equipment, labor, permitting, and battery storage if applicable. This is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in your federal tax liability.

On a $28,000 system, the ITC saves you **$8,400**, bringing your net cost down to **$19,600**.

### Florida's Sales and Property Tax Exemptions

Florida sweetens the deal further with two powerful state-level incentives:

- **100% sales tax exemption** on solar equipment purchases — saving you roughly **$1,500 to $2,200** on a typical system
- **100% property tax exemption** on the added home value from solar — meaning your property taxes stay the same even though your home is now worth $15,000 to $25,000 more

### Net Metering Credits

Through Florida's net metering program, FPL credits you at the **full retail rate** for every kilowatt-hour your panels send back to the grid. During the sunniest months, many homeowners generate more electricity than they use, building up credits that offset their nighttime and cloudy-day usage.

This means your remaining FPL bill — typically just the $10 to $15 minimum connection charge — stays minimal.

### Your True Out-of-Pocket Solar Cost

After the 30% ITC and Florida's sales tax exemption, the net cost of a typical residential solar system falls to approximately **$15,000 to $23,000**. With $0-down financing through [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com), many homeowners lock in a monthly payment that is **equal to or less than their current FPL bill** — from day one.

That monthly payment is fixed. It does not increase 3% to 5% every year. It does not spike after hurricanes. It is locked in for the life of the loan.

## Side-by-Side: Solar vs. FPL Over 25 Years

Here is the comparison that changes minds. We will use a Florida homeowner with a $190/month FPL bill, a 10 kW solar system costing $28,000 before incentives ($19,600 after ITC), and a 4% annual utility rate increase.

### Scenario 1: Stay on FPL

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Starting monthly bill | $190 |
| Year 25 monthly bill | $507 |
| Total paid over 25 years | ~$95,000 |
| Equity built | $0 |
| Home value increase | $0 |
| Control over costs | None |

### Scenario 2: Go Solar

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Net system cost (after ITC) | ~$19,600 |
| Monthly loan payment ($0 down) | ~$135 to $165 |
| Loan term | 10 to 15 years |
| Monthly cost after loan payoff | ~$10 to $15 (grid connection fee) |
| Total paid over 25 years | ~$22,000 to $30,000 |
| Equity built | Full system ownership |
| Home value increase | $15,000 to $25,000 |
| Control over costs | Full |

### The Bottom Line

**Total cost with FPL: ~$95,000**
**Total cost with solar: ~$22,000 to $30,000**
**Net savings with solar: $65,000 to $73,000+**

And that does not even account for the $15,000 to $25,000 increase in your home's resale value. When you factor that in, going solar is not just cheaper — it is one of the highest-return investments a Florida homeowner can make.

## The Breakeven Point: When Solar Starts Paying You Back

One of the most common questions we hear at [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com) is: "How long until the system pays for itself?"

### Typical Florida Breakeven Timeline

For most Florida homeowners, the solar breakeven point falls between **5 and 8 years**. Here is how that works:

1. **Years 1 through 5-8:** Your monthly solar loan payment is roughly equal to (or less than) what you were paying FPL. You are not saving dramatically yet, but you are not spending more either — and your cost is locked in while FPL rates keep climbing.

2. **The crossover:** Somewhere between year 5 and year 8, the cumulative amount you have paid for solar (loan payments + minimal grid fees) equals what you *would have* paid FPL. From this point forward, every dollar of electricity your panels produce is pure savings.

3. **Years 8 through 15:** If you financed over 12 to 15 years, you are still making loan payments, but FPL rates have now climbed significantly. Your fixed solar payment looks better and better by comparison. If you financed over 10 years, your loan is paid off and you are generating nearly free electricity while your neighbors' bills keep rising.

### What Accelerates the Breakeven

Several factors can push your breakeven point earlier:

- **Higher starting FPL bill** — homeowners paying $250+ per month often break even in 4 to 6 years
- **Faster rate increases** — if FPL raises rates by 5% instead of 4%, the crossover comes sooner
- **Paying cash** — eliminating interest costs compresses the breakeven to 5 to 7 years for most homeowners
- **Battery storage with time-of-use optimization** — maximizing self-consumption can further reduce your grid dependency

---

## What Happens After Your Solar System Is Paid Off

This is where the solar investment really shines — and where the comparison with FPL becomes almost absurd.

### Years 15 Through 25: The Free Electricity Window

Once your solar loan is paid off (or immediately, if you paid cash), your monthly electricity cost drops to the **FPL minimum connection charge of roughly $10 to $15 per month**. That is it.

Meanwhile, if you had stayed on FPL, your bill in year 15 would be around $340/month and climbing to over $500/month by year 25.

Let us do the math on just this post-payoff period:

- **FPL cost for years 15 through 25:** approximately $47,000 to $55,000
- **Solar cost for years 15 through 25:** approximately $1,200 to $1,800 (minimum connection charges only)

That is **$45,000 to $53,000 in savings** during the post-payoff period alone. This is money that stays in your pocket, your retirement account, your children's college fund — anywhere but FPL's balance sheet.

### System Performance Over Time

Modern solar panels are built to last. Most tier-1 manufacturers guarantee at least **80% to 85% production capacity at year 25**. The degradation rate is typically only **0.3% to 0.5% per year**, meaning a system that produces 14,000 kWh in year one will still produce approximately 12,000 to 13,000 kWh in year 25.

At [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com), every installation comes with a **25-year warranty** covering panels, inverters, and workmanship — so you are protected for the full lifespan of the system. Our in-house installation crews (no subcontractors) ensure the job is done right the first time.

## Hidden Costs of Grid Dependence That Most People Overlook

The FPL bill you see each month is not the full story. Staying fully dependent on the grid carries several costs that do not show up as line items.

### Vulnerability to Power Outages

Florida leads the nation in power outages. Hurricanes, tropical storms, lightning strikes, and aging infrastructure all contribute to a grid that goes down more often than most Floridians would like. When the power goes out, you lose refrigerated food, comfort, medical equipment power, and productivity.

Solar paired with battery storage provides **backup power during outages** — a benefit that is difficult to put a dollar figure on but is invaluable when you need it.

### No Equity, No Asset, No Return

Every dollar you pay FPL is gone. You build no equity. You own nothing. There is no return on your "investment" because it is not an investment — it is an expense.

Solar, by contrast, is a **physical asset** installed on your property. It increases your home value, reduces your operating costs, and continues producing value for decades.

### Exposure to Policy Changes

Utility rates are set by regulators, but they are heavily influenced by utility company lobbying. Florida homeowners have no meaningful say in rate decisions. When FPL files for a rate increase, the Public Service Commission almost always approves some version of it.

With solar, your electricity generation is on your roof. No utility, no regulator, and no lobbyist can change what the sun gives you for free.

## The Verdict: Solar Wins — And It Is Not Close

Let us recap the 25-year comparison:

| Factor | FPL | Solar |
|--------|-----|-------|
| 25-year total cost | $65,000 to $110,000+ | $22,000 to $30,000 |
| Monthly cost trend | Increases every year | Fixed, then near-zero |
| Breakeven | Never — it is a perpetual expense | 5 to 8 years |
| Post-payoff cost | $340 to $507/month (and rising) | $10 to $15/month |
| Home value impact | None | +$15,000 to $25,000 |
| Outage protection | None | Yes (with battery) |
| Control over costs | Zero | Full |

The question is not whether solar saves money. The question is how much you are willing to pay FPL before you make the switch.

Florida homeowners who go solar today are locking in their energy costs, building equity in a real asset, protecting themselves from rate increases and outages, and setting themselves up for 15+ years of near-free electricity after their system is paid off.

At [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com), we offer **$0-down financing**, a **25-year comprehensive warranty**, **in-house bilingual installation crews**, and a transparent process built on letting the numbers speak for themselves. No pressure. No gimmicks. Just math.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does FPL electricity cost over 25 years in Florida?

At current rates with a conservative 3% to 5% annual increase, the average Florida homeowner will pay FPL between $65,000 and $110,000 over 25 years. Homeowners with higher usage or larger homes can expect even more. These projections are based on FPL's historical rate increase patterns, which have been consistent for over two decades.

### How long does it take for solar panels to pay for themselves in Florida?

Most Florida homeowners reach their solar breakeven point in 5 to 8 years, depending on system size, energy usage, financing terms, and the rate at which FPL increases prices. After breakeven, the remaining 15 to 20 years of the system's lifespan produce electricity at virtually no cost beyond the minimal grid connection fee.

### Is solar worth it in Florida with FPL net metering?

Yes. FPL's current net metering program credits solar homeowners at the full retail rate for excess electricity sent back to the grid. This means your panels effectively "store" energy on the grid during peak production hours and you draw it back at night without additional cost. Combined with the 30% federal tax credit and Florida's tax exemptions, solar delivers substantial long-term savings.

### What happens to my solar savings if FPL changes its rates?

If FPL raises rates — which historical data strongly suggests they will — your solar savings actually increase. Every rate hike makes the electricity your panels produce more valuable because you are avoiding a higher per-kilowatt-hour cost. This is one of solar's most powerful financial advantages: the worse utility rates get, the better your investment performs.

### Does RIV Solar offer $0-down financing for Florida homeowners?

Yes. [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com) offers $0-down financing options that allow Florida homeowners to go solar with no upfront cost. Your monthly solar payment is typically equal to or less than your current FPL bill, but unlike your utility bill, that payment is fixed and will never increase. Every installation includes a 25-year warranty and is completed by our in-house bilingual crews.
