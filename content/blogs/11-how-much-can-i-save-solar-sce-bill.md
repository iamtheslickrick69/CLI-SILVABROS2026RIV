# How Much Can I Save with Solar on My SCE Bill?

**The short answer: Most SCE customers save $100-300+ per month with solar, reducing bills from $250-400 down to $10-20.** Southern California Edison serves the Inland Empire, Orange County, and much of Central California—areas with high rates (42¢/kWh), intense summer heat, and excellent solar production. Here's exactly what you can expect to save.

## SCE Rates in 2026

Southern California Edison is the third most expensive utility in California:

| Utility | 2026 Rate | Average Monthly Bill |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| SDG&E | 55¢/kWh | $385 |
| PG&E | 45¢/kWh | $315 |
| **SCE** | **42¢/kWh** | **$294** |
| National Average | 16¢/kWh | $140 |

**SCE customers pay nearly 3x the national average.**

### SCE Time-of-Use Rates (TOU-D-4-9PM):

| Period | Summer Rate | Winter Rate |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Off-Peak (before 4 PM, after 9 PM) | 35¢ | 36¢ |
| Peak (4 PM - 9 PM) | 54¢ | 48¢ |
| Super Off-Peak (varies) | 30¢ | 32¢ |

Peak hours—when you're home using electricity—cost 54¢/kWh in summer.

## Why SCE Territory Is Excellent for Solar

### 1. Abundant Sunshine

SCE serves some of California's sunniest regions:
- **Inland Empire:** 285+ sunny days/year
- **Coachella Valley:** 300+ sunny days/year
- **Central Valley:** 270+ sunny days/year

More sun = more solar production = more savings.

### 2. High Summer Cooling Loads

SCE territory includes hot areas:
- Riverside: Average summer high 96°F
- San Bernardino: Average summer high 98°F
- Palm Springs: Average summer high 108°F
- Bakersfield: Average summer high 98°F

Heavy AC use drives summer bills to $400-700. Solar eliminates that peak-season pain.

### 3. Rate Increases Continue

SCE rates have more than doubled since 2014 and continue climbing:

| Year | SCE Rate | % Increase |
|------|----------|------------|
| 2014 | 19¢ | — |
| 2018 | 23¢ | +21% |
| 2022 | 33¢ | +74% |
| 2026 | 42¢ | +121% |
| 2030 (projected) | 55¢ | +189% |

Every year you wait, you're paying higher rates.

## The SCE Time-of-Use Challenge

SCE's TOU pricing creates a specific challenge:

**Peak hours (4-9 PM)** are when:
- You get home from work
- AC runs hardest (afternoon heat)
- Kids use devices
- Cooking appliances run
- TVs and lights are on

**But solar produces most electricity midday**, when you're at work and using less.

### The Solution: Battery Storage

With a battery (Tesla Powerwall, Enphase, Franklin):
1. **Daytime:** Solar charges your battery
2. **Peak hours (4-9 PM):** Battery powers your home
3. **Result:** Avoid 54¢/kWh peak rates entirely

Without a battery, you export excess daytime solar for low NEM 3.0 credits, then buy peak-rate power in the evening. With a battery, you keep all that value.

## SCE Rate Plans: Choosing the Right One

SCE offers multiple rate plans. With solar, the best option depends on your usage patterns and whether you have a battery:

### TOU-D-4-9PM (Default)
- **Peak:** 4-9 PM
- **Best for:** Most solar customers without batteries
- **Why:** Peak hours align with post-solar production; battery optimizes this

### TOU-D-5-8PM
- **Peak:** 5-8 PM (shorter peak window)
- **Best for:** Customers who can shift usage outside those hours
- **Why:** Narrower peak means less exposure to high rates

### TOU-D-PRIME
- **Peak:** 4-9 PM with different rate structure
- **Best for:** EV owners
- **Why:** Designed for electric vehicle charging optimization

**Pro tip:** After going solar, work with your installer to optimize your rate plan. The right plan can save an additional 5-10% annually.

## NEM 3.0 Impact on SCE Savings

California's Net Energy Metering 3.0 policy (April 2023) changed how excess solar is credited:

### Before NEM 3.0:
Export excess solar → Receive near-retail credits → Use credits to offset evening usage

### Under NEM 3.0:
Export excess solar → Receive reduced credits (5-8¢/kWh) → Credits cover less evening usage

### What This Means for SCE Customers:

| Strategy | NEM 2.0 Value | NEM 3.0 Value |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Export 1 kWh midday | ~38¢ credit | ~6¢ credit |
| Store 1 kWh, use at peak | 38¢ | 54¢ |
| Self-consume immediately | 38¢ | 42¢ |

**Battery storage is significantly more valuable under NEM 3.0.** Storing excess production for peak-hour use captures 10x more value than exporting.

## Adding an EV? Factor It In

Many SCE customers are adding or planning electric vehicles. This changes your solar calculation:

### EV Electricity Usage:
- Average driving: 12,000 miles/year
- EV efficiency: 3-4 miles/kWh
- Annual electricity: 3,000-4,000 kWh
- Monthly cost on SCE: **$105-140/month**

### Smart Approach:
Size your solar system for current usage PLUS EV charging. A system that produces 4,000 extra kWh/year covers your car's fuel cost with sunshine.

**Result:** Your EV costs nothing to fuel—solar covers it.

## Key Takeaways

- **SCE customers pay 42¢/kWh** with peak rates hitting 54¢
- **Average savings: $150-300/month** depending on current bill
- **Payback period: 5-7 years** for most SCE households
- **25-year savings: $50,000-120,000** vs. staying with SCE
- **Battery storage highly recommended** for peak-rate optimization under NEM 3.0
- **SCE territory has excellent sunshine**, maximizing solar production

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What size solar system do I need to eliminate my SCE bill?
A rough rule: 1 kW of solar offsets about $50-60/month of SCE usage. A $300/month bill needs approximately 7-8 kW. We'll calculate your exact needs based on your actual usage patterns.

### Will I still have an SCE bill after going solar?
Yes, but minimal. You'll pay the basic connection fee ($10-15/month) to remain grid-connected. This covers metering and backup power access.

### How does SCE's TOU-D-PRIME rate work with solar?
TOU-D-PRIME is designed for EV owners with specific overnight charging incentives. It can work well with solar + battery systems that charge EVs from stored solar power.

### Can I go completely off-grid in SCE territory?
Technically yes, but it's rarely recommended. Staying grid-connected provides backup power and may be required by local codes. The economics of on-grid solar + battery are typically better.

### When is the best time to install solar in SCE territory?
Anytime, but installing before summer maximizes first-year savings. Summer bills are often 2x winter bills in SCE's hot service territory.

### Does SCE offer any solar incentives?
SCE doesn't offer direct solar rebates, but you're eligible for federal (30% tax credit) and state (SGIP battery rebates) incentives. SCE administers NEM 3.0 crediting for excess production.
