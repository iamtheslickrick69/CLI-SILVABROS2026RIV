# FPL Net Metering Explained: Maximize Your Florida Solar Savings

**Net metering is one of the biggest reasons solar pays off so well in Florida.** FPL (Florida Power & Light) offers full retail net metering, meaning you get credited at the same rate you pay for every kWh your panels send back to the grid.

Here's everything FPL customers need to know about net metering in 2026.

## What Is Net Metering?

Net metering is a billing arrangement where your solar panels can "spin your meter backwards." When your panels produce more electricity than you're using, the excess flows to the grid — and FPL credits you for it.

**Simple example:**
- Your panels produce 50 kWh on a sunny day
- You use 30 kWh during daylight hours
- 20 kWh flows to the grid
- FPL credits you for those 20 kWh at the full retail rate

At night, you draw power from the grid. At the end of the month, you only pay for the *net* difference — hence "net metering."

## How FPL Net Metering Works

### Credit Rate

FPL uses **1:1 retail net metering**, meaning your export credits equal the retail rate you pay:

| FPL Rate Tier | Export Credit |
|---------------|---------------|
| First 1,000 kWh | Full retail rate |
| Over 1,000 kWh | Full retail rate |
| Peak hours | Full peak rate |
| Off-peak hours | Full off-peak rate |

This is one of the most generous net metering policies in the country.

### Monthly True-Up

FPL tracks your credits monthly. If you produce more than you use:
- Excess credits roll over to next month
- Credits accumulate during sunny months (spring)
- Credits offset usage during high-AC months (summer)

### Annual Settlement

At the end of your annual billing period:
- Any remaining credits are paid out at the "avoided cost rate" (~3-4¢/kWh)
- This is why proper system sizing matters — you want to use most of your credits

## Maximizing FPL Net Metering Savings

### 1. Right-Size Your System

The goal is to produce roughly 100-110% of your annual usage:
- Too small = you still pay FPL for the difference
- Too big = excess credits paid at low avoided cost rate
- Just right = maximum savings, minimal waste

### 2. Shift Usage to Daytime

When possible, run energy-intensive appliances during peak solar hours:
- Pool pumps: Schedule for 10am-2pm
- EV charging: Charge during daylight
- Laundry/dishwasher: Run midday when panels peak

### 3. Consider Battery Storage

While FPL's net metering is generous, batteries offer additional benefits:
- Store solar for evening use (higher value)
- Backup power during outages (Florida storms)
- Time-of-use optimization (if FPL adds TOU rates)

## FPL Net Metering vs. Other States

Florida homeowners are lucky. Compare to other states:

| State | Net Metering Policy |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Florida (FPL)** | **Full retail 1:1** |
| California (NEM 3.0) | ~25% of retail |
| Nevada | Declining rates |
| Arizona | Credit-based, not retail |

California's NEM 3.0 cut solar export credits by 75%. Florida's policy remains intact and valuable.

## Applying for FPL Net Metering

Your solar installer handles the paperwork, but here's the process:

1. **Application:** Submit interconnection agreement to FPL
2. **Review:** FPL reviews system design (2-4 weeks)
3. **Approval:** Receive Permission to Operate (PTO)
4. **Installation:** Complete within 12 months of approval
5. **Inspection:** FPL inspects and activates net meter

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does FPL charge fees for net metering?

No monthly fees for net metering itself. You'll still see:
- Customer charge (~$8/month)
- Minimum bill (typically waived with solar)
- Taxes and fees on any net usage

### Can I sell excess power to FPL?

Yes, but at the avoided cost rate (~3-4¢/kWh). It's better to size your system to use most of your production.

### What happens during a power outage?

Standard solar systems shut off during outages (safety requirement). Battery backup systems keep running even when the grid is down.

### Will FPL change net metering?

Florida has protected net metering through legislation. While changes are always possible, the current policy is stable through at least 2026.

## The Bottom Line

FPL's net metering policy makes Florida one of the best states for solar. You get:
- Full retail credit for every kWh exported
- Monthly rollover of excess credits
- Simple, straightforward billing
- No additional fees

Combined with Florida's abundant sunshine and strong tax incentives, FPL customers are in an ideal position to save 50-80% on electricity with solar.
