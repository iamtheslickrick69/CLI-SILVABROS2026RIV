## Step 1: Consultation and Quote

### What Happens:

**Initial contact:**
- You reach out (or respond to our outreach)
- We gather basic info: address, utility, approximate bill

**Site assessment:**
- Review satellite imagery of your roof
- Analyze sun exposure, shading, orientation
- Check roof condition and type
- Note any obstacles (vents, skylights, trees)

**Bill analysis:**
- Review your utility bill history
- Calculate annual energy usage
- Identify usage patterns

**System design and quote:**
- Size the system to your needs
- Select appropriate equipment
- Calculate savings and ROI
- Present financing options

### What You Do:

- Provide utility bills (12 months ideal)
- Answer questions about future plans (EV, additions, pool)
- Review and compare quotes (get 2-3)
- Ask questions—no pressure
- Decide to proceed

### Red Flags to Watch:

- Pressure to sign "today only"
- Unwillingness to leave written quote
- Vague equipment specifications
- Refusal to explain financing terms

### Timeline: 1-2 weeks

---

## Step 2: Custom Design

### What Happens:

**Site survey:**
- Detailed roof measurements
- Electrical panel inspection
- Shade analysis (sometimes with specialized tools)
- Identify installation challenges
- Confirm structural adequacy

**Engineering:**
- Precise panel placement layout
- Electrical system design
- Structural calculations
- Code compliance verification

**Final system design:**
- Exact panel count and placement
- Inverter selection and sizing
- Battery integration (if applicable)
- Electrical routing plan

**Contract finalization:**
- Final pricing based on actual site conditions
- Equipment specifications confirmed
- Warranty terms documented
- Installation timeline established

### What You Do:

- Allow access for site survey
- Confirm any last questions
- Sign final contract
- Arrange financing (if applicable)

### Possible Adjustments:

Sometimes the site survey reveals issues:
- Roof needs repair → May delay or require coordination
- Electrical panel needs upgrade → Added cost
- More shading than expected → Reduced system size
- Structural concerns → Engineering solutions needed

### Timeline: 1-2 weeks

---

## Step 3: Permitting and Approvals

### What Happens:

**Building permit:**
- Submit plans to local building department
- Include structural, electrical, and fire safety plans
- Pay permit fees (included in your contract)
- Wait for approval

**Utility interconnection application:**
- Apply to PG&E, SCE, or SDG&E
- Submit system specifications
- Request net metering agreement
- Await approval to connect

**HOA approval (if applicable):**
- Submit plans per HOA requirements
- California law limits HOA restrictions, but process required
- Typically just notification, not true "approval"

### What You Do:

- Very little—your installer handles this
- Be available if additional information needed
- Patience—permitting is the biggest delay

### Why It Takes So Long:

- Building departments have backlogs
- Each jurisdiction has different processes
- Complex systems require additional review
- Utilities process applications in order received

### Timeline: 2-4 weeks (sometimes longer)

## Step 4: Installation Day(s)

### What Happens:

**Day 1: Roof Work**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 7-8 AM | Crew arrives, reviews site |
| 8-10 AM | Install roof attachments (flashings) |
| 10 AM-12 PM | Mount racking system |
| 12-1 PM | Lunch break |
| 1-4 PM | Install solar panels |
| 4-5 PM | Secure wiring, clean up |

**Day 2: Electrical Work (if needed)**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 8-10 AM | Install inverter |
| 10 AM-12 PM | Run conduit and wiring |
| 12-1 PM | Lunch break |
| 1-3 PM | Connect to electrical panel |
| 3-4 PM | Install monitoring equipment |
| 4-5 PM | Test systems, final cleanup |

### What You Experience:

- Noise on the roof (drilling, walking)
- Crew members on your property
- Brief power shutoff during electrical connection
- Debris and equipment (cleaned up daily)

### What You Do:

- Be home or available by phone
- Keep pets away from work area
- Provide access (side gates, etc.)
- Inspect work at completion

### Do I Need to Be Home?

Preferred but not required. Someone should be reachable by phone and able to inspect/sign at completion.

### Timeline: 1-2 days (larger systems may take 3)

---

## Step 5: Inspection and Activation

### What Happens:

**Building inspection:**
- City/county inspector visits
- Reviews electrical work
- Checks structural mounting
- Verifies code compliance
- Issues final permit approval

**Utility inspection (sometimes):**
- Utility may inspect the installation
- Verifies meter and interconnection
- Confirms system matches application

**Permission to Operate (PTO):**
- Utility reviews final documentation
- Approves your system for grid connection
- You're officially allowed to turn it on

**System activation:**
- Installer or you turn on the system
- Monitor for proper operation
- Begin generating electricity!

### What You Do:

- Be available for inspection (or arrange access)
- Review final walkthrough with installer
- Confirm monitoring app is working
- Understand how to read your production

### The Waiting Game:

PTO can take 2-4 weeks after installation. During this time:
- Your system is installed but OFF
- You're still paying full utility bills
- Frustrating, but legally required

Some installers handle PTO faster than others—ask about their typical timeline.

### Timeline: 2-4 weeks

---

## What to Expect During Each Phase

### Communication:

Good installers provide:
- Regular status updates
- Clear timeline expectations
- Single point of contact
- Prompt responses to questions

### If Something Goes Wrong:

**Permit delays:** Common. Not installer's fault, but they should be proactive.
**Weather delays:** Installation may be rescheduled if unsafe conditions.
**Equipment delays:** Supply chain issues happen. Discuss alternatives if needed.
**Failed inspection:** Installer corrects issues at no cost and reschedules.

## After Installation: What to Know

### Your Monitoring System:

- App shows real-time production
- Tracks daily, monthly, annual output
- Alerts for system issues
- Compares production to estimates

### Your First Bill:

- May still show charges (usage during PTO wait)
- Future bills show net usage (consumption minus production)
- True-up annually under most rate plans

### Maintenance:

- Panels need very little maintenance
- Rain cleans them naturally
- Occasional inspection recommended
- Inverter may need attention in 10-15 years

### Warranty Coverage:

- Panel warranty: 25 years
- Inverter warranty: 12-25 years
- Workmanship warranty: Varies (ours is 25 years)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does it take so long if installation is only 1-2 days?
Permitting and utility approval dominate the timeline. Each jurisdiction and utility has its own process and backlog.

### Can I speed up the process?
Some things help: responding quickly to information requests, having your roof in good condition, being available for surveys/inspections. But permit timelines are largely out of anyone's control.

### Will installation damage my roof?
Proper installation includes waterproof flashings at every penetration. Quality installers warranty their roof work for 25 years. Leaks are extremely rare with proper technique.

### What if it rains during installation?
Installation will be rescheduled. Panels and equipment are weather-resistant, but safe installation requires dry conditions.

### Do I need to take time off work?
You should be available (in person or by phone) for the site survey, installation day(s), and inspection. Some homeowners don't need to take off work if they can be reached by phone.

### What happens if inspection fails?
The installer corrects any issues at no cost to you and reschedules. This is rare with experienced installers.
