# The True Cost of NOT Going Solar in the Sunshine State

**Every month without solar panels in Florida, the average homeowner sends $150 to $250 to their utility company with zero return on investment. When you factor in rising FPL and Duke Energy rates, hurricane outage expenses, and lost property value, the true cost of not going solar in Florida exceeds $100,000 over 25 years.**

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Florida homeowners pay $150 to $250 per month in electricity** — and FPL and Duke Energy rates have increased 3% to 5% annually over the past decade, with no sign of slowing down.
- **Hurricane-related power outages cost the average Florida family $1,500 to $5,000 per event** when you account for spoiled food, hotel stays, generator fuel, medical equipment risks, and lost productivity.
- **Solar panels add $15,000 to $20,000 in property value** to a Florida home, and the state's property tax exemption means you pay zero additional taxes on that increase.
- **Over 25 years, the opportunity cost of utility payments versus solar ownership can exceed $100,000** when you account for rate increases, lost equity, and foregone home value appreciation.
- **Florida ranks among the top three states in the nation for solar production potential**, making every month without panels a measurable financial loss.

## The Real Cost of Depending on FPL and Duke Energy

Most Florida homeowners do not think of their electric bill as a major financial decision. It is just another monthly expense, like water or internet. You receive the bill, you pay it, and you move on.

But here is the reality that utility companies would prefer you not dwell on: **your electricity bill is likely your single largest recurring household expense after your mortgage.** And unlike your mortgage, which builds equity, every dollar you send to FPL or Duke Energy is gone forever. You own nothing in return.

### What Florida Homeowners Actually Pay

The average Florida household pays between $150 and $250 per month for electricity. During the brutal summer months — June through September — when air conditioning runs almost continuously, that figure regularly climbs above $300 for many families.

Let us put that into perspective with simple math:

- **$200 per month** equals **$2,400 per year**
- Over **10 years**, that is **$24,000**
- Over **25 years**, that is **$60,000** — and that assumes rates never increase

But rates always increase. Which brings us to the part that should genuinely concern every Florida homeowner.

### You Are Renting Your Electricity

Think of it this way. Paying your utility bill every month is the energy equivalent of renting an apartment. You make your payment, you get temporary use of the service, and at the end of the year you have nothing to show for it. No equity. No asset. No return.

Solar ownership flips that equation entirely. Instead of renting your electricity from FPL or Duke Energy, you own the system that produces it. Every panel on your roof is a productive asset that generates value for decades.

## FPL and Duke Energy Rate Projections: The Numbers Are Not in Your Favor

If electricity rates stayed flat, the cost of not going solar would still be significant. But rates do not stay flat in Florida. They climb — consistently and relentlessly.

### A Decade of Rate Increases

Over the past ten years, Florida utility rates have increased an average of **3% to 5% per year**. FPL alone has pushed through multiple base rate increases, fuel cost adjustments, and storm recovery surcharges. Duke Energy Florida has followed a similar trajectory.

Here is what that compounding effect looks like for a homeowner currently paying $200 per month:

| Year | Monthly Bill (3% Annual Increase) | Monthly Bill (5% Annual Increase) |
|------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Today | $200 | $200 |
| Year 5 | $232 | $255 |
| Year 10 | $269 | $326 |
| Year 15 | $311 | $416 |
| Year 20 | $361 | $531 |
| Year 25 | $419 | $677 |

At a conservative 3% annual increase, your $200 monthly bill becomes $419 in 25 years. At 5%, it reaches $677 per month. **The total paid to your utility over 25 years at 3% growth comes to roughly $87,000.** At 5%, it exceeds $114,000.

And that money buys you exactly nothing. No equity. No asset. No protection against the next rate hike.

### Why Rates Will Keep Rising

Florida's rate increases are not random. They are driven by structural factors that are not going away:

- **Infrastructure upgrades**: The grid is aging, and utilities are passing modernization costs to ratepayers.
- **Storm hardening**: After each major hurricane season, utilities invest billions in grid hardening and recover those costs through surcharges on your bill.
- **Fuel cost volatility**: Natural gas prices fluctuate, and Florida utilities are heavily dependent on gas-fired generation. When fuel costs spike, so does your bill.
- **Regulatory environment**: Florida's Public Service Commission has historically approved utility rate increase requests. Between 2020 and 2025 alone, FPL secured multiple significant base rate increases.

When you go solar, you step off this escalator entirely. Your electricity comes from your own roof, produced by a system you own, with a cost that is locked in on day one.

## Hurricane Outage Costs: The Expense Nobody Budgets For

Florida homeowners know hurricanes are part of life. What many do not fully calculate is the **financial cost** of extended power outages — costs that go far beyond the inconvenience of sitting in the dark.

### The Hidden Price Tag of a Major Outage

When a hurricane knocks out power for three to seven days — which is common in Florida — the expenses stack up fast:

- **Spoiled food**: A fully stocked refrigerator and freezer can hold $200 to $500 worth of groceries. After 24 to 48 hours without power, most of it is gone.
- **Hotel stays**: When the house becomes uninhabitable due to heat, many families relocate to hotels. At $150 to $250 per night for a family, a five-day stay costs $750 to $1,250.
- **Generator fuel**: Portable generators burn through $30 to $75 in fuel per day, depending on the load. A week-long outage can cost $200 to $500 in gas alone — if you can find gas stations that are open and have supply.
- **Lost income**: Remote workers who cannot work without power lose productivity and, in some cases, pay.
- **Medical equipment**: Families with members who depend on powered medical devices face life-threatening situations. The cost of emergency alternatives is both financial and emotional.
- **Damaged property**: Without power, sump pumps fail, dehumidifiers stop running, and secondary water or mold damage can occur.

A single significant hurricane event can cost a Florida family **$1,500 to $5,000 or more** in outage-related expenses alone. And Florida averages a direct or near-direct hurricane impact every two to three years.

### Solar Plus Battery: The Outage Solution

A solar panel system paired with battery storage — such as the Tesla Powerwall, Enphase IQ Battery, or Franklin WholHome — keeps your home powered when the grid goes down. Your panels continue generating electricity during the day, your batteries store it, and your home stays operational while your neighbors wait for FPL or Duke Energy to restore service.

At [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com), we design every Florida battery installation to prioritize the circuits that matter most during an outage: refrigeration, lighting, Wi-Fi, medical equipment, and essential outlets. Many of our customers with battery backup rode through recent hurricane seasons without losing power for a single hour.

That is not just convenience. It is thousands of dollars in avoided costs every time a storm hits.

## Property Value Impact: What You Are Leaving on the Table

Here is a cost of not going solar that many Florida homeowners never consider: **the home value you are forfeiting by not having panels on your roof.**

### Solar Adds $15,000 to $20,000 in Home Value

Research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory consistently shows that solar panels increase a home's resale value. In Florida's market, that premium typically falls between **$15,000 and $20,000** for a standard residential system.

Buyers are willing to pay more for a home with solar because they understand what it means: lower monthly bills, protection against rate increases, and — if the system includes batteries — resilience during storms.

### Florida's Property Tax Exemption Makes It Even Better

Here is where Florida's solar policy really shines. Under the state's **100% property tax exemption for solar energy systems**, the added value from your solar panels is completely exempt from property tax assessment.

That means your home is worth $15,000 to $20,000 more on the open market, but your annual property taxes do not increase by a single dollar. This is a benefit that very few states offer at this level, and it makes the financial case for solar in Florida even more compelling.

### The Flip Side: Homes Without Solar

As solar adoption accelerates across Florida — and it is accelerating rapidly — homes without solar panels will increasingly be seen as homes with a financial liability. Buyers will look at a non-solar home and see $200-plus monthly electric bills stretching into the future, no storm resilience, and no hedge against rate increases.

The cost of not going solar is not just the money you are paying today. It is the equity you are failing to build and the resale premium you are leaving on the table.

---

## The Opportunity Cost: What Else That Money Could Do

Financial advisors talk about opportunity cost — the value of what you give up when you choose one option over another. When it comes to utility payments, the opportunity cost is enormous.

### $60,000 to $114,000 Sent to the Utility

Over 25 years, the average Florida homeowner will send between $60,000 and $114,000 to FPL or Duke Energy, depending on rate increases. That is money that generates zero return. It does not grow. It does not compound. It does not build anything.

### What Solar Ownership Looks Like Instead

A residential solar system in Florida typically costs between $20,000 and $35,000 before incentives. After the **30% federal Investment Tax Credit**, the net cost drops to $14,000 to $24,500. With $0-down financing options — which [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com) offers on every installation — you can start generating savings from month one without any upfront cost.

Here is the comparison:

| | Without Solar | With Solar |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly cost | $200+ and rising | Fixed loan payment (often lower than current bill) |
| 25-year total paid | $60,000 to $114,000 | $25,000 to $45,000 (including loan interest) |
| Asset owned at the end | Nothing | Solar system still producing free electricity |
| Home value impact | None | +$15,000 to $20,000 |
| Storm protection | None | Full backup with battery storage |

The difference is not subtle. It is tens of thousands of dollars redirected from a utility company's revenue statement to your own household balance sheet.

### What Could You Do With $50,000 to $70,000 in Savings?

That is the range of net savings most Florida homeowners realize over the life of a solar system compared to staying on grid power. Invested in a college fund, a home renovation, retirement savings, or simply kept in your pocket, that money has real impact on your family's financial trajectory.

## The Irony of the Sunshine State: Florida Has the Sun but Wastes It

There is a deep irony in Florida's relationship with solar energy. The state literally markets itself as the **Sunshine State**. It receives 230 to 265 sunny days per year. It ranks among the top two or three states in the nation for total solar irradiance.

And yet, for decades, the vast majority of Florida homeowners have paid some of the highest electricity rates in the Southeast while the most abundant energy source available — sunlight — hits their rooftops for free every single day.

### The Numbers on Florida's Solar Potential

A typical residential solar system in Florida produces **1,400 to 1,600 kilowatt-hours per installed kilowatt per year**. That is among the highest production rates in the country, surpassed only by the desert Southwest. A standard 8 to 10 kW system on a Florida rooftop generates enough electricity to offset 90% to 100% of the average household's consumption.

The sun is already there. It is already shining on your roof. The only question is whether you are converting it into savings or letting it go to waste while you write another check to FPL.

### Why Florida Lagged Behind — and Why That Is Changing

Historically, Florida's solar adoption lagged behind states like California, Arizona, and Texas due to utility lobbying and policy obstacles. But the landscape has shifted dramatically in recent years. Net metering is available from all major utilities. The 30% federal tax credit remains in effect. Sales tax and property tax exemptions are fully in place. And public awareness of solar's financial benefits has reached a tipping point.

The cost of not going solar was always high in Florida. The difference now is that there are virtually no barriers left to going solar.

## What Going Solar Actually Changes for Florida Homeowners

Switching from utility dependence to solar ownership is not just a financial decision. It changes your relationship with energy entirely.

### You Lock In Your Energy Costs

Instead of being subject to whatever FPL or Duke Energy decides to charge next year, your energy cost is fixed the moment your system is installed. Whether rates go up 3%, 5%, or 10%, your cost stays the same.

### You Build Equity Instead of Burning Cash

Every loan payment on a solar system builds equity in a productive asset. Every utility payment builds equity in nothing. Over time, the solar system pays for itself and then continues producing free electricity for years — often a decade or more — beyond the payoff date.

### You Gain Storm Resilience

With battery backup, your home stays powered during outages. You keep your food cold, your lights on, your family comfortable, and your medical equipment running. The financial and emotional value of that resilience is difficult to overstate in a state that faces hurricane threats every year.

### You Increase Your Home's Market Value

As outlined above, solar adds $15,000 to $20,000 to your home's value — tax-free in Florida. Whether you plan to sell in five years or stay for thirty, that equity is real and meaningful.

### You Reduce Your Environmental Impact

A standard Florida residential solar system offsets approximately 3 to 4 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Over 25 years, that is 75 to 100 tons of CO2 that does not enter the atmosphere. For homeowners who care about their environmental footprint, solar is the single most impactful step you can take.

## Getting Started: How to Stop Paying the Cost of Not Going Solar

If the numbers in this article have you rethinking your utility bill, here is what the path to solar looks like in Florida:

### Step 1: Get a Personalized Assessment

Every home is different. Roof orientation, shading, square footage, and electricity usage all factor into system design. [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com) provides free, no-obligation assessments that analyze your specific situation and show exactly what solar would look like for your home.

### Step 2: Review Your Custom Proposal

Based on your assessment, you will receive a detailed proposal including system size, estimated production, battery options, financing terms, and projected savings. Everything is transparent — no hidden fees, no pressure.

### Step 3: Choose Your Financing

RIV Solar offers **$0-down financing** that allows most Florida homeowners to go solar with a monthly payment that is lower than their current electric bill. You can also pay cash or use a home equity line of credit. The 30% federal tax credit applies regardless of how you pay.

### Step 4: Professional Installation

RIV Solar uses **in-house installation crews** — not subcontractors — backed by a **25-year comprehensive warranty**. Installation typically takes one to two days, and our bilingual team ensures clear communication throughout the process.

### Step 5: Start Saving

Once your system is interconnected and approved by your utility, you start generating your own electricity immediately. Most Florida homeowners see an 80% to 100% reduction in their electric bill from month one.

The cost of not going solar in Florida is real, it is measurable, and it grows every single month. The good news is that eliminating that cost has never been easier or more affordable.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does the average Florida homeowner spend on electricity over 25 years without solar?

At current rates with a conservative 3% annual increase, the average Florida homeowner paying $200 per month today will spend approximately $87,000 on electricity over 25 years. With a 5% annual increase, that figure exceeds $114,000. None of that money builds equity or provides any return on investment.

### Is FPL electricity expensive compared to other states?

Florida electricity rates are above the national average and among the highest in the Southeast. FPL and Duke Energy have both implemented significant rate increases in recent years, and additional increases are expected due to infrastructure upgrades, storm hardening costs, and fuel price volatility. For many Florida homeowners, electricity is their largest recurring bill after their mortgage.

### Why should I go solar in Florida specifically?

Florida ranks among the top three states in the nation for solar energy production potential. With 230 to 265 sunny days per year, a standard residential system generates enough electricity to offset most or all of a household's consumption. Combined with the 30% federal tax credit, zero state sales tax on solar equipment, full property tax exemption on added home value, and net metering from all major utilities, Florida offers one of the strongest financial cases for solar in the country.

### Does solar really add value to a Florida home?

Yes. Studies consistently show that solar panels add $15,000 to $20,000 in resale value to residential properties. In Florida, this benefit is amplified by the state's 100% property tax exemption for solar energy systems, meaning your home is worth more on the market but your property taxes do not increase. As solar adoption grows, homes without solar may increasingly be viewed as having a financial disadvantage.

### Can I go solar in Florida with no money down?

Absolutely. RIV Solar offers $0-down financing options that allow homeowners to go solar with a monthly payment that often comes in below their current electric bill. This means you can start saving from day one without any upfront investment. The 30% federal Investment Tax Credit further reduces the total cost of the system, and Florida's sales tax exemption means you pay no state tax on your solar equipment.
