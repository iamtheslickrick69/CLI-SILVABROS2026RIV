# Solar Is Not for Everyone — How to Know If It's Right for You (PR Edition)

**Solar energy is an excellent investment for most Puerto Rico homeowners — but not all. If you have good sun exposure, pay more than $150 per month to LUMA, plan to stay in your home at least five years, and have a structurally sound roof, solar is likely a smart financial move. If heavy shade, a tiny roof, or an imminent move defines your situation, it may not be. Here is how to know for sure.**

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Solar works for the majority of Puerto Rico homeowners**, but a responsible installer will evaluate your specific situation before recommending a system — not after you have already signed a contract.
- **The strongest candidates for solar** have monthly LUMA bills above $150, a roof with good sun exposure, plans to stay in their home five or more years, and a desire for outage protection.
- **Solar may not make sense** if your roof has severe shading, significant structural damage, extremely limited space, or if you plan to sell your home within the next year or two.
- **Many "gray area" situations can still work** — partial shading, moderate bills, older roofs — but they require an honest assessment of the numbers, not a sales pitch.
- **The biggest red flag when shopping for solar** is a company that tells every single person that solar is perfect for them. It is not, and any honest installer will tell you that upfront.

## Why We Are Writing This: The RIV Solar Philosophy

Most solar companies will never publish an article like this one.

Their marketing tells every homeowner the same thing: solar is perfect for you, you are losing money every day without it, sign up now before it is too late. It does not matter if your roof faces north, if a massive flamboyan tree covers half your panels, or if you are planning to relocate in six months. To them, every home is a sale.

We do not operate that way.

At RIV Solar, our core philosophy is simple: **solar is not for everyone — we let the numbers speak.** That is not a tagline designed to sound humble. It is how we actually run our business. When we evaluate a home, we look at the data — your roof orientation, shade profile, energy consumption, financial situation, and long-term plans. If the numbers say solar will save you money and improve your quality of life, we will show you exactly how. If they do not, we will tell you that too.

Why? Because telling someone solar is not right for them today builds a relationship. That homeowner trusts us. They refer their neighbors. And when their situation changes — maybe they get a new roof, or the tree comes down, or they buy a different house — they come back.

Overselling destroys trust. Honesty builds it. That distinction matters, and it is the reason you are reading this article right now.

## When Solar IS Right for You: The Checklist

For most Puerto Rico homeowners, solar is not just a good idea — it is one of the best financial decisions available. Here are the indicators that solar is likely a strong fit for your home.

### Your Monthly LUMA Bill Is $150 or More

This is the single most important factor. If you are paying LUMA $150 to $400 or more per month — which is extremely common in Puerto Rico given rates that average 24+ cents per kilowatt hour — a solar system can dramatically reduce or eliminate that expense. The higher your bill, the faster the system pays for itself, and the greater your lifetime savings.

For households paying $200 or more per month, the math is almost always overwhelmingly in favor of solar.

### Your Roof Gets Good Sun Exposure

Puerto Rico sits at roughly 18 degrees north latitude and receives an average of 5.5 peak sun hours per day. That is significantly more than most of the mainland United States. If your roof has a south-facing, east-facing, or west-facing section that is relatively free of heavy shade for most of the day, it is likely an excellent candidate for solar production.

You do not need a perfect roof. Even homes with partial shading can perform well with modern microinverter technology that optimizes each panel independently. But the more sun, the more energy, and the better the return on investment.

### You Plan to Stay in Your Home at Least Five Years

Solar is a long-term investment. The typical payback period in Puerto Rico ranges from four to seven years depending on your system size, energy consumption, and financing structure. After payback, every kilowatt hour your system generates is essentially free electricity for the remaining 20+ years of the system's life.

If you plan to stay in your home five years or more, you will almost certainly recoup your investment and then some. If you plan to stay 10, 15, or 25 years, the cumulative savings can reach $40,000 to $80,000 or more.

### You Want Protection from Outages

LUMA Energy's grid is projected to experience over 150 hours of service interruptions annually. If you have experienced blackouts that lasted hours or days — losing food, losing work-from-home income, running a loud generator, or simply sweating through tropical nights without air conditioning — solar with battery backup changes everything.

A solar-plus-battery system turns your home into its own power plant. When the grid goes down, your lights stay on. That resilience has a financial value, but it also has a quality-of-life value that is difficult to put a price on.

### Your Roof Is Structurally Sound

Solar panels are designed to last 25 to 30 years. If your roof is in good condition and does not need replacement in the near future, installing solar now makes sense. If your roof needs replacement within the next few years, the ideal move is to replace the roof first and then install solar — so you are not paying to remove and reinstall panels down the road.

---

## When Solar Might NOT Be Right for You: An Honest Assessment

Here is where most solar companies go silent. We are going to be direct.

### Your Roof Has Severe, Unresolvable Shading

If your home is surrounded by tall buildings or large mature trees that cast heavy shade across your entire roof for most of the day, solar production may be too limited to justify the investment. Modern technology handles partial shade well, but if 70% or more of your usable roof space is shaded during peak sun hours, the system will underperform and the financial return may not be there.

Note the word "unresolvable." If the shading comes from trees you own and are willing to trim or remove, the situation changes entirely. This is a conversation, not an automatic disqualification.

### Your Roof Is Too Small or Has an Unfavorable Layout

Some homes — particularly older homes in dense urban areas, small concrete structures, or homes with complex multi-level rooflines — simply do not have enough contiguous roof space to install a system large enough to make a meaningful impact on your electric bill. If your usable roof area can only accommodate three or four panels, the cost per watt installed becomes less favorable and the savings may be minimal.

### You Are Planning to Move Within a Year or Two

Solar increases home value, and homes with solar often sell faster. But if you are actively planning to sell your home in the next 12 months, the logistics of installing a system, completing interconnection with LUMA, and then marketing the home with a new solar system can be complicated. The buyer may not value the system the same way you do, and financed systems add a layer of complexity to the sale.

If your move is 18 months to two years out, the calculus starts to shift — particularly if you are paying high LUMA bills in the interim. But for imminent moves, it may make more sense to install solar on your next home.

### Your Electric Bill Is Extremely Low

If you are a single occupant in a small home, use minimal air conditioning, and your LUMA bill consistently runs below $60 to $80 per month, the savings from solar may not be enough to justify the investment. Solar works best when it is displacing a significant amount of expensive grid electricity. If there is not much electricity to displace, the return on investment stretches out considerably.

This is relatively rare in Puerto Rico given the climate and rates, but it does happen.

### Your Roof Needs Major Structural Repairs

If your roof has significant structural damage — cracked concrete, compromised trusses, active leaks, or deterioration from hurricane damage that was never properly repaired — adding solar panels before addressing those issues is not advisable. The panels themselves add weight, and the mounting hardware requires a solid substrate. Fix the roof first, then go solar.

## The Gray Areas: When It Depends

Not every situation is black and white. Some of the most common questions we get fall into a gray area where the answer is genuinely "it depends on your specific numbers."

### "I Have Some Shade, but Not Total Shade"

Partial shade is one of the most misunderstood factors in solar. Many homeowners assume any shade disqualifies them, and many aggressive solar companies ignore shade entirely. The truth is somewhere in the middle.

Modern microinverter systems — like the Enphase IQ series — optimize each panel independently. If one panel is shaded while the rest are in full sun, only that one panel's output drops. The rest of the system is unaffected. This means homes with 20% to 40% partial shading on portions of the roof can still be excellent solar candidates.

The key is a proper shade analysis using satellite imagery, drone surveys, or on-site evaluation tools. If a company tells you shade does not matter at all, or that shade disqualifies you entirely, they are oversimplifying a nuanced situation.

### "My Roof Is 10-15 Years Old"

A roof that has 10 to 15 years of life remaining can still be a good candidate for solar. You will likely need to replace the roof during the life of the solar system, but a responsible installer can design the system with that eventuality in mind — using mounting hardware that simplifies future panel removal and reinstallation.

Some homeowners choose to replace the roof proactively before going solar, which is ideal. Others install solar now and budget for a roof replacement in 10 years. Both approaches work, but the decision should be made with full awareness of the costs involved.

### "My Bill Is Around $100-$130 per Month"

This is the gray zone. A $120 LUMA bill represents roughly 490 kWh of monthly consumption. A system sized to offset that usage would be relatively small — perhaps 3 to 4 kW — and the monthly savings would be more modest than a household paying $300. The system still pays for itself, but the payback period is longer and the lifetime savings are lower.

In these cases, the decision often comes down to whether outage protection matters to you. If keeping the lights on during blackouts is important, a solar-plus-battery system provides value beyond the bill savings alone. If you are evaluating purely on financials, we will show you the exact numbers and let you decide.

## How to Evaluate Your Specific Situation

Instead of guessing, here is a straightforward process for determining whether solar makes sense for your home.

### Step 1: Gather Your Last 12 Months of LUMA Bills

Your annual energy consumption tells a much more accurate story than a single month. Puerto Rico homes use more electricity during summer months (more air conditioning) and less during winter. A full year of data gives us the real picture.

### Step 2: Assess Your Roof Condition

Walk around your home. Look for visible damage, sagging, active leaks, or areas where water pools after rain. If your roof is concrete (common in Puerto Rico), check for cracks and deterioration. If it is standing seam metal, check for rust or loose seams. You do not need to be a roofing expert — just note what you see.

### Step 3: Check Your Sun Exposure

At midday on a sunny day, look at your roof. How much of it is in direct sunlight? Are there trees or neighboring structures casting shade on significant portions? Which direction does the main roof surface face? South-facing is ideal in Puerto Rico, but east and west orientations work well too. North-facing is the least productive but can still work in Puerto Rico's latitude.

### Step 4: Consider Your Timeline

How long do you plan to live in this home? Are there any major life changes coming — a move, a renovation, a roof replacement? Solar is a 25-year asset. The longer you plan to stay, the more value it delivers.

### Step 5: Get a Professional Evaluation

After you have gathered this information, a reputable solar installer should conduct a thorough site assessment that includes satellite imagery analysis, shade modeling, roof structural evaluation, and a custom system design based on your actual consumption patterns. This evaluation should be free, thorough, and come with no obligation to buy.

## What a Good Solar Consultation Looks Like

A legitimate solar consultation is not a high-pressure sales pitch in your living room. Here is what you should expect from a company that is actually trying to help you make the right decision.

**They ask more questions than they answer.** A good consultant wants to understand your energy usage, your goals, your budget, your timeline, and your concerns before they ever talk about equipment or pricing.

**They show you the numbers, not just the dream.** You should see your actual LUMA bills analyzed, a production estimate based on your specific roof, a clear financial comparison of solar versus staying on the grid, and a payback timeline. If they cannot show you this, they are selling, not consulting.

**They tell you what they found — even if it is bad news.** If your roof needs work, they should say so. If your shade profile limits your production, they should quantify it. If your bill is too low to justify the investment, they should tell you honestly.

**They do not pressure you to sign the same day.** Any company that says the price expires today, or the incentive disappears tomorrow, or that you need to commit right now is using a pressure tactic, not making you a genuine offer. Legitimate pricing holds. Legitimate incentives have known timelines.

**They explain the warranty in plain language.** What is covered, what is not, for how long, and what happens if the company goes out of business. A 25-year warranty from a company that might not exist in three years is not really a warranty.

## Red Flags from Companies That Say Solar Is for Everyone

If a solar company tells you any of the following, proceed with extreme caution.

**"Solar is perfect for every home."** It is not. Every home is different, and some are genuinely poor candidates. A company that cannot identify when solar is not a good fit either lacks expertise or lacks honesty.

**"Do not worry about the shade."** Shade matters. How much it matters depends on the specifics, but dismissing it entirely is a red flag.

**"You need to sign today to get this price."** This is a classic high-pressure sales tactic. If the price is real, it will be real tomorrow too.

**"We handle everything — you do not need to understand the details."** You are making a 25-year commitment. You absolutely need to understand the details — your system size, expected production, warranty terms, financing structure, and net metering credits.

**"Everyone in your neighborhood is going solar."** Maybe they are, maybe they are not. But your decision should be based on your home, your bills, and your situation — not social pressure.

**"There is no reason not to go solar."** There are several legitimate reasons, and we just listed them above. Any company that cannot name a single scenario where solar is not the right choice is a company that puts sales before service.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if solar is worth it for my specific home in Puerto Rico?

The most reliable way to determine if solar is worth it for your home is to have a professional site assessment that evaluates your roof orientation, shade profile, structural condition, and your actual LUMA energy consumption over the past 12 months. If your monthly bill exceeds $150, your roof gets decent sun, and you plan to stay at least five years, the numbers almost always favor solar. A reputable installer will show you the exact payback period and lifetime savings before asking you to commit.

### What if my roof has partial shade — does that disqualify me from solar?

No. Partial shade does not automatically disqualify your home. Modern microinverter technology optimizes each panel independently, so shaded panels do not drag down the performance of unshaded panels. Homes with 20% to 40% partial shading can still achieve strong solar production and solid financial returns. The key is a proper shade analysis — not a guess — to quantify exactly how shade affects your specific system's projected output.

### Should I get solar panels if I am planning to sell my home in a few years?

It depends on your timeline. If you are selling within the next 12 months, installing solar may add complexity to the transaction without enough time to recoup the investment directly. However, if you are two to three years or more from selling, solar can both save you money on LUMA bills in the interim and increase your home's market value. Homes with owned solar systems typically sell faster and at a premium in Puerto Rico's current market.

### Can I go solar if my roof is older or needs some repairs?

You can, but it requires careful planning. If your roof has 10 to 15 years of usable life remaining, solar can still be installed with the understanding that you may need to temporarily remove panels during a future roof replacement. If your roof has major structural issues — significant cracks, active leaks, or compromised integrity — those should be repaired before solar installation. A responsible installer will assess your roof condition as part of the consultation and advise you honestly.

### Why does RIV Solar say solar is not for everyone?

Because it is the truth, and we believe honesty is better business than overpromising. Homes with severe shading, extremely low energy usage, structural roof problems, or owners who plan to move very soon may not see a strong financial return from solar. Rather than sell a system that underdelivers, we prefer to be upfront about these situations. This approach builds trust, earns referrals, and ensures that every system we install actually performs as promised for the homeowner.
