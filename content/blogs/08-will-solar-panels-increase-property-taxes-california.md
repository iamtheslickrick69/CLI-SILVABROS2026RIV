# Will Solar Panels Increase My Property Taxes in California?

**The short answer: No. California law exempts solar installations from property tax reassessment.** Your home's market value increases with solar, but your property taxes won't go up because of it. This exemption makes California one of the best states for solar economics. Here's exactly how it works.

## The Property Tax Exemption Explained

### How Property Taxes Normally Work

In California, your property is reassessed when you make improvements that add value. New rooms, pools, renovations—these increase your assessed value and, therefore, your property taxes.

The general rule: **1% of assessed value + local bonds and fees = annual property tax**

### How Solar Is Different

Under California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 73, **active solar energy systems are excluded from property tax reassessment** through January 1, 2027 (and likely to be extended, as it has been multiple times).

This means:
- Solar panels? **No tax increase.**
- Inverters? **No tax increase.**
- Battery storage? **No tax increase.**
- Mounting equipment? **No tax increase.**

## Real-World Example

### Without the Exemption (Hypothetical):
- Home value before solar: $600,000
- Solar system adds: $25,000 in value
- New assessed value: $625,000
- Additional annual property tax: **~$250/year**
- Over 25 years: **$6,250+ in extra taxes**

### With California's Exemption (Actual):
- Home value before solar: $600,000
- Solar system adds: $25,000 in value
- Assessed value for tax purposes: **Still $600,000**
- Additional annual property tax: **$0**
- Over 25 years: **$0 in extra taxes**

The exemption means you get the equity boost without the tax penalty.

## What Qualifies for the Exemption?

### Covered Equipment:
- Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels
- Solar inverters (string and micro)
- Mounting and racking systems
- Solar monitoring equipment
- Battery storage systems (when part of solar installation)
- Electrical upgrades required for solar installation

### NOT Covered:
- Solar pool heaters (passive solar)
- Solar water heaters (covered under a different, similar exemption)
- Equipment not directly part of the active solar system
- Structural changes beyond what's necessary for solar

### Key Distinction: Active vs. Passive Solar
The exemption specifically covers "active solar energy systems"—those that generate electricity. Passive solar (architectural features that capture heat) doesn't qualify, though solar thermal water heaters have their own similar exemption.

## How Does My Home Value Still Increase?

Here's where it gets interesting:

### For Tax Assessment:
The county assessor ignores your solar installation. Your assessed value stays the same as if you never installed solar.

### For Market Value:
When you sell your home, the solar system absolutely adds value. Studies show solar homes sell for **4-6% more** than comparable non-solar homes in California.

### The Best of Both Worlds:
- **Owning:** Pay no extra property taxes
- **Selling:** Capture the added home value
- **Net result:** Pure upside

## Do I Need to Apply for the Exemption?

### Short Answer: Usually No

In most California counties, the exemption is automatic. When your solar permit is pulled and finalized, the county assessor's office notes that it's an excluded solar installation.

### However, To Be Safe:

Some counties may require you to file a simple form:
1. Check with your county assessor's office
2. Ask your solar installer (they often handle this)
3. If required, the form is typically straightforward

### Documentation to Keep:
- Solar permit documents
- Installation contract
- Final inspection approval
- Any correspondence with the assessor's office

---

## The Exemption Timeline

### History:
California first enacted the solar property tax exemption in 1980. It's been extended multiple times:
- Extended to 2017
- Extended to 2025
- Most recently extended to **January 1, 2027**

### Will It Be Extended Again?
Almost certainly. This exemption has strong bipartisan support as part of California's clean energy goals. It has never been allowed to expire.

### If You're Installing in 2026:
Your installation qualifies under current law. Even if the exemption isn't extended (unlikely), your existing installation would be grandfathered in—you wouldn't suddenly face reassessment.

## What Happens When I Sell My House?

### During the Sale:
Your solar system is a selling point. Buyers know they're getting:
- Lower electricity bills
- Modern, efficient equipment
- Protection from rate increases

### For the New Owner:
When the property changes hands, California's Proposition 13 triggers a full reassessment anyway. At that point:
- The home is reassessed at the sale price
- The solar system is STILL excluded from that reassessment
- The new owner benefits from the same exemption

### Property Value Studies:
Research shows California solar homes sell for an average of **$15,000-$25,000 more** than equivalent non-solar homes. One study (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) found premiums of **$4 per watt installed**.

For a typical 8 kW system: 8,000 watts × $4 = **$32,000 potential value add**

## Comparison: California vs. Other States

California's exemption is among the best in the country:

| State | Property Tax Treatment |
|-------|------------------------|
| **California** | 100% exemption (no increase) |
| Arizona | 100% exemption |
| New Jersey | 100% exemption |
| Texas | 100% exemption |
| Florida | 80% exemption |
| New York | 15-year exemption |
| Illinois | Limited exemption |
| Many others | No exemption (solar increases taxes) |

If you live in California, you're in one of the most favorable states for solar property tax treatment.

## Frequently Misunderstood Points

### "My Assessed Value Went Up—Did Solar Cause It?"

Probably not. California reassesses properties for other reasons:
- **Proposition 13 inflation adjustment:** Up to 2% annual increase
- **Other improvements:** Non-solar renovations
- **Errors:** Assessor mistakes (can be appealed)

If your assessment increased significantly, check what triggered it. Solar is explicitly excluded.

### "My Neighbor Said They Got a Tax Bill After Solar"

This occasionally happens when:
- The permit wasn't coded correctly
- The county made an error
- The assessment was for something else (same timeframe, different improvement)

If this happens, **it's correctable.** Contact your county assessor with your solar permit and installation documents.

### "What About the Mello-Roos Tax?"

Mello-Roos (Community Facilities District taxes) are separate from property tax and based on a different formula. Solar exemptions don't affect Mello-Roos assessments, but Mello-Roos also doesn't typically increase due to solar installations.

---

## Battery Storage: Also Exempt?

### Yes, With a Caveat

Battery storage systems are exempt when they're:
- Installed as part of a solar energy system
- Charged primarily (50%+) by the solar installation

### Standalone Batteries:
If you install a battery without solar (charging from the grid only), it may not qualify for the exemption. The language specifies "active solar energy systems."

### Best Practice:
Install solar and battery together. Both qualify for the property tax exemption AND the 30% federal tax credit.

## Key Takeaways

- **California exempts solar from property tax reassessment**—your taxes won't increase
- **The exemption is automatic** in most counties
- **Your home value still increases** for resale purposes—you get equity without the tax
- **Battery storage is included** when part of a solar system
- **The exemption is active through 2027** and has been consistently extended
- **No application typically required**, but keep documentation just in case

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to tell the county I installed solar?
The permit process typically notifies the assessor automatically. However, you can proactively contact your county assessor's office to confirm the exemption is applied.

### What if my property taxes increase after installing solar?
First, check what caused the increase—it's likely the annual Proposition 13 adjustment (up to 2%) or another improvement. If solar is incorrectly triggering the increase, file an appeal with documentation.

### Does the exemption apply to commercial solar?
Different rules apply to commercial properties. The residential exemption is straightforward; commercial may have partial exemption depending on the situation.

### Will future owners also get the exemption?
Yes. The exemption applies to the property, not the owner. When the home sells and is reassessed, the new owner continues to benefit from the solar exclusion.

### What if I expand my solar system later?
Additional panels and equipment qualify for the same exemption. The expansion itself doesn't trigger reassessment of the original system or the home.

### How does this compare to the federal tax credit?
They're completely separate benefits:
- **Federal tax credit:** One-time 30% reduction in federal taxes
- **Property tax exemption:** Ongoing exclusion from state/local property taxes
- **Both apply:** You get both benefits simultaneously

✅ Lower electricity bills
✅ Higher home value
✅ No property tax increase
✅ 30% federal tax credit
✅ Protection from utility rate increases

**It's all upside.**
