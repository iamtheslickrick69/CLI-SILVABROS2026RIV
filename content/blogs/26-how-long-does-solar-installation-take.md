# How Long Does Solar Installation Actually Take?

**The short answer: Physical installation takes 1-2 days. The entire process from contract to producing electricity takes 6-12 weeks.** Most of that time is permits and utility approval—not actual work on your home. Here's a detailed timeline breakdown so you know exactly what to expect.

---

## The Two Timelines

### Timeline 1: Physical Installation
**1-2 days** for most residential systems

This is what happens on your roof:
- Day 1: Mounting hardware, racking, panels
- Day 2: Electrical connections, inverter, monitoring (if needed)

Larger systems (12+ kW) or complex roofs may take 3 days.

### Timeline 2: Total Process
**6-12 weeks** from signing to savings

This includes:
- Design and engineering
- Permit applications and approval
- Utility interconnection application
- Physical installation
- Final inspection
- Permission to Operate (PTO)

---

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Weeks 1-2: Design and Site Survey

**What happens:**
- Detailed roof measurements
- Electrical panel assessment
- Shade analysis
- Engineering calculations
- Final system design
- Contract finalization

**Your involvement:** Minimal. Allow access for survey.

### Weeks 3-6: Permitting

**What happens:**
- Plans submitted to building department
- Utility interconnection application filed
- HOA notification (if applicable)
- Wait for approvals

**Your involvement:** None. Just waiting.

**Why it takes so long:**
- Building departments have backlogs
- Each application is reviewed by multiple departments
- Revision requests can add time
- Different jurisdictions have different timelines

### Week 6 or 7: Installation

**What happens:**
- Crew arrives with equipment
- Install roof attachments and flashing
- Mount racking system
- Install solar panels
- Run conduit and wiring
- Install inverter and monitoring
- Connect to electrical panel

**Your involvement:** Be available. Brief power shutoff during connection.

### Weeks 7-10: Inspection and PTO

**What happens:**
- Building inspector visits
- Reviews electrical and structural work
- Utility reviews final documentation
- Permission to Operate (PTO) issued
- System activated

**Your involvement:** Be available for inspection or provide access.

- Service entrance work

**3. Permit backlogs**
- High-demand seasons (spring/summer)
- Understaffed departments
- Complex jurisdiction requirements

**4. HOA requirements**

## What You'll Experience During Installation

### Noise:
- Drilling into roof (mounting)
- Walking on roof
- Power tools
- Typical construction sounds

### People on Property:
- 3-6 crew members
- Trucks and equipment in driveway
- Activity around electrical panel

### Brief Disruption:
- Power off for 30-60 minutes during panel connection
- Request advance notice to prepare

### End of Day:
- All debris cleaned up
- Equipment removed
- Roof returned to normal appearance
- System tested but NOT activated (needs PTO)

## The PTO Waiting Game

### What is PTO?
Permission to Operate—your utility's official approval to turn on your system and connect to the grid.

### Why Does It Take So Long?

After installation:
1. Final inspection must pass
2. Installer submits completion documents to utility
3. Utility reviews documentation
4. Utility may schedule their own inspection
5. PTO letter issued
6. You can finally turn on your system

### Typical PTO Timeline:

| Utility | Typical Wait |
|---------|--------------|
| SDG&E | 2-3 weeks |
| PG&E | 2-4 weeks |
| SCE | 3-4 weeks |

### The Frustration:
Your panels are installed. Sun is shining on them. You're looking at them from your backyard. **But you can't turn them on.** You're still paying full utility bills.

This is the most frustrating part for most homeowners. It's legally required, and there's no shortcut.

## System Size and Timeline

| System Size | Installation Time | Total Timeline |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 4-6 kW (small) | 1 day | 6-8 weeks |
| 6-10 kW (typical) | 1-2 days | 6-10 weeks |
| 10-15 kW (large) | 2-3 days | 8-12 weeks |
| 15+ kW (very large) | 3+ days | 10-14 weeks |

Larger systems may require additional permits, more installation time, and longer utility review.

## Battery Addition Timeline

Adding battery storage affects timing:

### Battery with Solar Installation:
- Adds 0.5-1 day to installation
- May require separate electrical permit
- Separate inspection sometimes needed
- Adds 1-2 weeks to total timeline

### Retrofitting Battery Later:
- New permit application (1-3 weeks)
- Installation (0.5-1 day)
- New inspection (1-2 weeks)
- Total: 4-6 weeks additional

## What Can You Do to Speed Things Up?

### Before You Sign:
- Have 12 months of utility bills ready
- Know if your HOA has solar requirements
- Inform installer of any known roof issues
- Mention planned electrical upgrades (EV charger, etc.)

### During Process:
- Respond promptly to any requests
- Provide access as needed
- Be available for site survey and inspection
- Trust the process (most delays are outside anyone's control)

### What You CAN'T Speed Up:
- Permit processing times
- Utility approval queues
- Inspection scheduling
- Weather delays

## Red Flags About Timeline

Be cautious if an installer promises:

**"We'll have you running in 2 weeks"**
- Unless permits are pre-approved, this is unrealistic
- May indicate cutting corners

**"Our timeline is always 4 weeks"**
- Permit times vary by jurisdiction
- No installer controls permitting

**"Don't worry about the process"**
- Good installers explain timeline clearly
- Vagueness can hide delays

**Legitimate Timeline Estimates:**
- "Typically 6-10 weeks, depending on your jurisdiction"
- "We'll know more after submitting permits"
- "Here's our current average for your city: X weeks"

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Physical installation:** 1-2 days for most homes
- **Total process:** 6-12 weeks from contract to savings
- **Biggest delays:** Permitting and utility PTO
- **Your involvement:** Minimal—mostly waiting
- **Installation day:** Expect noise, brief power outage, crews on property
- **PTO wait:** Most frustrating part—system installed but can't turn on

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does solar take so long if installation is just 1-2 days?
Permitting and utility approval dominate the timeline. These are government and utility processes that move at their own pace, regardless of how fast installation goes.

### Can I use my solar before PTO?
No. It's illegal to operate without permission from your utility. Your inverter is programmed not to activate without PTO.

### What if weather delays my installation?
It will be rescheduled. A few days of weather delay is normal and doesn't affect your contract or pricing.

### Is a faster timeline always better?
Not necessarily. Rushed work can mean errors. A company that consistently hits reasonable timelines with quality work is better than one promising impossible speed.

### Can I pay extra to speed things up?
No. Permit processing and utility approval don't have paid expedite options for residential solar.

### What's the quickest you've seen?
In ideal conditions (simple roof, fast permit jurisdiction, quick utility), some installations complete in 4-5 weeks. This is the exception, not the rule.
