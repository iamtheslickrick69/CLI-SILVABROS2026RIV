# PG&E Rates in 2026: Why Your Bill Keeps Rising and What to Do About It

**The short answer: PG&E rates have increased 114% since 2014 and continue climbing 7-9% annually.** Infrastructure costs, wildfire liability, and the clean energy transition are driving relentless increases with no end in sight. The only way to escape this cycle is to generate your own power. Here's the full breakdown and your options.

## PG&E Rate History: The Brutal Truth

Let's look at the actual numbers:

| Year | PG&E Average Rate (per kWh) | % Increase from 2014 |
|------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| 2014 | 21.0¢ | — |
| 2016 | 23.5¢ | +12% |
| 2018 | 25.0¢ | +19% |
| 2020 | 28.5¢ | +36% |
| 2022 | 36.0¢ | +71% |
| 2024 | 42.0¢ | +100% |
| 2026 | 45.0-48.0¢ | +114-129% |

**Your electric bill has more than doubled in 12 years.** And that's just the average—many PG&E customers on tiered or Time-of-Use plans pay even more during peak periods.

## Why PG&E Rates Keep Rising

### 1. Wildfire Liability and Prevention

PG&E equipment has been linked to devastating wildfires:
- 2017 Wine Country fires
- 2018 Camp Fire (85 deaths, town of Paradise destroyed)
- Multiple smaller fires

The utility is spending billions on:
- Undergrounding power lines
- Vegetation management
- Equipment upgrades
- Settlement payments to fire victims

**Who pays for this?** You do, through higher rates.

### 2. Aging Infrastructure

Much of California's electrical grid was built 50-70 years ago. Replacing:
- Old transmission lines
- Deteriorating substations
- Outdated transformers

This infrastructure debt has been deferred for decades. Now the bill is coming due—passed directly to ratepayers.

### 3. Clean Energy Transition

California mandates 100% clean electricity by 2045. This requires:
- Massive solar and wind farms
- New transmission lines to deliver renewable power
- Grid-scale battery storage
- Decommissioning old plants

Worthy goals, but expensive—and rate increases fund the transition.

### 4. Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS)

When fire conditions are dangerous, PG&E shuts off power to prevent equipment-sparked fires. These planned blackouts:
- Affect millions of customers
- Require expensive monitoring systems
- Don't reduce your bill despite the lost service

You pay for infrastructure you can't always use.

### 5. General Inflation and Labor Costs

Like everything else, utility operating costs have increased:
- Higher wages for lineworkers
- Expensive materials and equipment
- Increased compliance and regulatory costs

## What Your PG&E Bill Actually Includes

Most people don't realize their bill has multiple components:

### Generation Charges (~40-50%)
The cost to produce or purchase electricity. This actually COULD decrease as renewable energy gets cheaper—but other costs overwhelm any savings.

### Transmission Charges (~10-15%)
Moving electricity from power plants to local substations. Includes those expensive new transmission lines.

### Distribution Charges (~30-40%)
Local delivery from substations to your home. This is where wildfire prevention and infrastructure costs hit hardest.

### Public Purpose Programs (~5-10%)
Funds for low-income assistance, energy efficiency programs, and renewable energy development.

### Taxes and Fees
Various state and local charges.

**The problem:** Even if generation costs drop, distribution and transmission costs are rising faster. There's no escaping the increases.

## The Time-of-Use Problem

PG&E has moved most residential customers to Time-of-Use (TOU) rates:

### Typical TOU Rate Structure (2026):

| Period | Hours | Rate per kWh |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Off-Peak | 12 AM - 3 PM | 38-42¢ |
| Peak | 4 PM - 9 PM | 55-65¢ |
| Super Off-Peak | Varies by season | 32-36¢ |

**The catch:** Peak hours are when most families use the most electricity:
- Coming home from work
- Cooking dinner
- Running AC in summer evenings
- Kids doing homework, using devices

TOU was designed for a world where solar + batteries could shift usage. Without solar, you're stuck paying premium rates during the hours you actually need power.

## Future Projections: It Gets Worse

Based on approved rate increases and projected infrastructure spending:

| Year | Projected PG&E Rate | Average Monthly Bill |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 2026 | 45-48¢ | $315-350 |
| 2028 | 52-56¢ | $375-420 |
| 2030 | 58-65¢ | $425-500 |

### Additional Factors Driving Future Increases:

**Electric Vehicle Adoption**
California mandates all new cars electric by 2035. Millions of EVs charging = massive grid demand increase = more infrastructure needed = higher rates.

**Data Center Boom**
AI and cloud computing are exploding. Data centers consume enormous amounts of electricity. California hosts many of them. More demand = higher rates.

**Electrification of Heating**
Gas appliances being phased out in favor of electric heat pumps. More electricity demand across the board.

**Climate-Related Costs**
More extreme weather means more damage, more blackouts, more repairs, more prevention measures—all passed to ratepayers.

## Your Options for Dealing with Rising PG&E Rates

### Option 1: Do Nothing (Not Recommended)

If you stay with the status quo:
- Bills continue rising 7-9% annually
- $315/month today becomes $500+/month by 2030
- **25-year cost: $150,000+ to PG&E**
- No protection from blackouts
- Zero energy independence

### Option 2: Conservation and Efficiency

Reduce your usage through:
- LED lighting
- Energy-efficient appliances
- Better insulation
- Smart thermostats
- Behavioral changes

**Reality:** Conservation helps but can't outpace rate increases. You might use 10% less, but rates go up 10%—you're back where you started.

### Option 3: Switch to Community Choice Aggregation (CCA)

CCAs like MCE, EBCE, or SJCE let you buy electricity from a different source while still using PG&E's grid.

**Pros:** Often slightly cheaper, greener energy mix
**Cons:** Still uses PG&E distribution (where biggest cost increases are), still subject to most rate increases, no blackout protection

### Option 4: Go Solar

Generate your own electricity and dramatically reduce or eliminate your PG&E bill.

**Pros:**
- Lock in your energy cost for 25+ years
- Eliminate or drastically reduce PG&E payments
- 30% federal tax credit
- Increase home value
- With battery: blackout protection

**Cons:**
- Upfront investment (though $0-down financing exists)
- Best economics for bills over $150/month
- Requires suitable roof or ground space

## The Solar Math for PG&E Customers

Let's compare staying with PG&E vs. going solar:

### Scenario: $315/month PG&E customer

**Without Solar (25 years):**
| Year | Monthly Bill | Annual Cost |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 2026 | $315 | $3,780 |
| 2030 | $450 | $5,400 |
| 2035 | $600 | $7,200 |
| 2045 | $900 | $10,800 |
| **Total** | — | **$175,000+** |

**With Solar:**
| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| System cost | $28,000 |
| 30% tax credit | -$8,400 |
| Net cost | $19,600 |
| Monthly payment (financed) | $120 |
| Monthly savings vs. $315 bill | $195 |
| Payback period | ~7 years |
| Years 8-25 | FREE electricity |
| **25-year cost** | **~$29,000** |

**Savings with solar: $146,000+ over 25 years**

## Why Battery Storage Matters for PG&E Customers

### Blackout Protection
PG&E's PSPS events can last days. A battery keeps critical systems running:
- Refrigerator
- Medical equipment
- Phone/computer charging
- Some lighting
- Security systems

### Peak Rate Avoidance
Store solar energy during the day, use it during expensive peak hours (4-9 PM). Avoid 55-65¢/kWh rates entirely.

### NEM 3.0 Optimization
Under NEM 3.0, exporting to the grid earns less. Storing excess solar for your own use is more valuable.

## Real Stories from PG&E Customers Who Went Solar

**Tom R., Stockton:**
> "Our PG&E bill was $380/month and climbing every year. Now we pay $15/month for the connection fee. The solar payment is $180—we're saving $185/month from day one."

**Sarah M., Fresno:**
> "The PSPS shutoffs were the last straw. We got solar with two Powerwalls. Last October, the power was out for 16 hours and we didn't even notice—the batteries kept everything running."

**David L., Santa Rosa:**
> "I calculated what I'd pay PG&E over the next 20 years with rate increases. Over $100,000. My solar system cost $22,000 after the tax credit. The math was obvious."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why can't PG&E just keep rates stable?
PG&E is a regulated utility that must fund mandated infrastructure improvements, wildfire prevention, and clean energy transition. These costs are passed directly to ratepayers through approved rate increases.

### Will rates ever go down?
There's no historical precedent for California utility rates decreasing. Even as renewable energy gets cheaper, distribution and transmission costs continue rising. Rates have increased every single year.

### Does going solar mean I leave PG&E?
No. You remain a PG&E customer for grid connection, net metering, and backup power. But instead of paying $300+/month, you pay just the basic connection fee ($15-20/month).

### What if I can't afford solar?
$0-down financing means your solar payment can be lower than your current PG&E bill—so you save money from day one without any upfront cost.

### Will PG&E oppose my solar installation?
No. PG&E is required to interconnect residential solar systems. The process is straightforward, though permitting and approval take 4-8 weeks.

### Are there any PG&E incentives for solar?
PG&E doesn't offer direct solar rebates, but you're eligible for all California incentives (SGIP battery rebate) and federal incentives (30% tax credit).
