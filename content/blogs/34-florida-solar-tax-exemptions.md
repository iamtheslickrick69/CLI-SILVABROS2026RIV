# What Are Florida's Solar Tax Exemptions? Sales & Property Tax Savings

**Florida offers two powerful solar tax exemptions: a complete sales tax exemption on solar equipment (saving roughly $1,800 on a typical system) and a 100% property tax exemption on the added home value from solar. Paired with the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit, Florida homeowners can cut their total solar costs by 30-40%.**

Going solar in Florida is one of the smartest financial moves a homeowner can make. The Sunshine State lives up to its name with over 230 days of sun per year, and state lawmakers have put real incentives in place to make the switch even more affordable. But here is the thing most homeowners miss: Florida does not offer a state tax credit or cash rebate for solar. Instead, it takes a different approach with two significant tax exemptions that put real money back in your pocket.

If you have been searching for "Florida solar tax exemptions" or "Florida solar incentives," you are in the right place. This guide breaks down every tax benefit available to Florida solar homeowners, explains exactly how much you can save, and shows you how to stack these incentives for maximum impact.

## Key Takeaways

- **Florida's sales tax exemption** removes the state's 6% sales tax from solar equipment purchases, saving approximately $1,500-$1,800 on a typical residential system.
- **The property tax exemption** ensures that 100% of the value solar adds to your home is exempt from property taxes, meaning your home value goes up but your tax bill stays the same.
- **The 30% federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)** is the single largest solar incentive, worth $7,500-$10,500 on most residential installations.
- **Florida has no state solar rebate or grant program**, so federal and state tax exemptions are the primary financial incentives.
- **Stacking all available incentives** can reduce the true cost of a solar system by 30-40% compared to the sticker price.

## Overview: Florida Solar Incentives in 2025

Florida ranks among the top states in the country for solar energy potential, but its incentive structure is different from states like California or New York. Rather than offering direct cash rebates or state-level tax credits, Florida focuses on removing tax barriers. That means fewer upfront checks in the mail but significant long-term savings that compound year after year.

Here is a quick snapshot of what Florida does and does not offer:

| Incentive | Available in Florida? | Estimated Savings |
|---|---|---|
| Sales Tax Exemption | Yes | ~$1,500-$1,800 |
| Property Tax Exemption | Yes | $500-$1,000+/year |
| 30% Federal ITC | Yes (federal) | $7,500-$10,500 |
| State Solar Rebate | No | N/A |
| State Tax Credit | No | N/A |
| Net Metering | Yes (varies by utility) | Varies |

Let's dig into each incentive so you understand exactly what you qualify for and how to claim it.

## Florida's Solar Sales Tax Exemption: Save $1,500-$1,800 Upfront

### How It Works

Under Florida Statute 212.08, solar energy systems are completely exempt from the state's 6% sales tax. This exemption covers the full cost of your solar panels, inverters, racking, wiring, and battery storage equipment. It applies automatically at the point of sale, meaning you do not need to file any special paperwork or claim it on your tax return.

### How Much You Actually Save

The math is straightforward. Florida's statewide sales tax rate is 6%, though many counties add a local surtax that can push the effective rate to 7-8%. The state exemption applies to the 6% portion. Here is what that looks like on real-world system sizes:

- **$25,000 system:** Save approximately $1,500 in sales tax
- **$30,000 system:** Save approximately $1,800 in sales tax
- **$40,000 system (with battery):** Save approximately $2,400 in sales tax

For a typical Florida home installing a 8-10 kW system in the $28,000-$32,000 range, you are looking at roughly $1,680-$1,920 in savings. That money never leaves your pocket in the first place, which makes this one of the most hassle-free solar incentives in the country.

### What Qualifies

The exemption covers equipment used to generate, store, or distribute solar energy, including:

- Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels
- Inverters (string and micro)
- Battery storage systems (like Tesla Powerwall or Enphase IQ)
- Mounting and racking hardware
- Associated wiring and electrical components

Labor costs for installation are generally not subject to Florida sales tax regardless of the solar exemption, so the exemption primarily applies to the equipment and materials portion of your contract.

### What You Need to Do

Nothing extra. Your solar installer handles this. When you work with a reputable Florida solar company like [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com), the sales tax exemption is already factored into your quoted price. You will never see that 6% charge on your contract. If a company quotes you a price that includes Florida sales tax on solar equipment, that is a red flag.

## Florida's Property Tax Exemption: Your Home Value Goes Up, Your Taxes Don't

### How It Works

This is the incentive that keeps paying you back year after year. Under Florida Statute 193.624, the added value that a solar energy system brings to your home is 100% exempt from property tax assessments. Solar panels typically increase a home's value by 3-4%, according to studies from Zillow and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In Florida, you get that value boost without a single dollar increase in your annual property tax bill.

### The Long-Term Math

Let's say you install a $30,000 solar system on a Florida home currently valued at $350,000. Studies suggest the solar installation could increase your home's market value by approximately $15,000-$20,000. Without the property tax exemption, here is what you would owe in additional property taxes:

- **Average Florida property tax rate:** Approximately 0.86%
- **Added home value from solar:** $17,500 (estimated)
- **Annual property tax you would owe without exemption:** ~$150/year
- **Over 25 years:** ~$3,750 in avoided property taxes

That $3,750 in savings is on top of the sales tax exemption and federal tax credit. And because Florida property values have been trending upward, the actual savings could be even higher over the life of your system.

### How to Claim It

The property tax exemption is applied through your county property appraiser's office. In most cases, the process works like this:

1. **Install your solar system** with a licensed installer.
2. **Notify your county property appraiser** that you have added a solar energy system. Some counties require you to submit a simple form; others apply it automatically.
3. **The appraiser excludes the solar value** from your taxable assessment.

Your installer should be able to guide you through this process. At RIV Solar, our team helps Florida homeowners understand which county-specific steps to take so the exemption is applied correctly from year one.

## The 30% Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC): The Biggest Single Incentive

### How It Works

The federal Investment Tax Credit, extended and enhanced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, allows homeowners to deduct 30% of their total solar installation cost from their federal income taxes. This is not a deduction that lowers your taxable income. It is a dollar-for-dollar credit that directly reduces the amount of tax you owe.

### How Much It Is Worth

The 30% ITC applies to the full installed cost of your system, including equipment, labor, permitting, and battery storage:

- **$25,000 system:** $7,500 tax credit
- **$30,000 system:** $9,000 tax credit
- **$35,000 system with battery:** $10,500 tax credit

The ITC is available at the 30% level for systems installed between 2022 and 2032. It steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 before expiring for residential systems in 2035 (unless Congress extends it again).

### Important Details

- **You must owe federal income taxes** to use the credit. If your tax liability is less than the credit amount, you can roll the unused portion forward to the following tax year.
- **The system must be installed on your primary or secondary residence.** Rental properties do not qualify for the residential ITC (though they may qualify for the commercial version).
- **Battery storage qualifies** even if it is added after the initial solar installation, as long as it is charged by the solar system.
- **You claim it on IRS Form 5695** when filing your annual federal tax return.

### Stacking With Florida's Exemptions

Here is where the numbers get exciting. The federal ITC is calculated on your out-of-pocket cost, which already reflects the Florida sales tax exemption. So you are effectively stacking benefits:

1. Florida sales tax exemption saves you ~$1,800 upfront (on a $30K system)
2. The 30% federal ITC saves you ~$9,000 on your federal taxes
3. Florida property tax exemption saves you ~$150/year ongoing

**Total first-year savings: approximately $10,800 on a $30,000 system.** That brings your effective cost down to around $19,200 before factoring in electricity bill savings.

## PACE Financing and SELF Loans: Additional Options for Florida Homeowners

Florida homeowners have access to financing programs that make going solar possible even without large upfront budgets.

### PACE Financing (Property Assessed Clean Energy)

PACE programs allow homeowners to finance solar installations through their property tax bill. The loan is attached to the property, not the homeowner, which means:

- No credit score minimum in most cases
- Repayment is made through your annual property tax assessment
- The loan transfers to the new owner if you sell the home

PACE is available in many Florida counties, though terms and interest rates vary. It is worth comparing PACE rates against traditional solar loans and $0-down options to ensure you are getting the best deal.

### SELF Loans (Solar and Energy Loan Fund)

The Solar and Energy Loan Fund (SELF) is a nonprofit Community Development Financial Institution that offers low-interest loans specifically for energy improvements, including solar installations. SELF loans are designed for homeowners who may not qualify for traditional financing and often feature:

- Competitive interest rates
- Flexible credit requirements
- Loan amounts tailored to solar installations

### $0-Down Solar Financing

Many Florida homeowners are surprised to learn they can go solar with no upfront cost. At RIV Solar, we offer [$0-down financing options](https://rivsolar.com) that allow you to start saving on electricity from day one. Combined with the federal ITC (which can be applied to pay down the loan balance) and Florida's tax exemptions, many homeowners find that their monthly solar payment is less than their old electric bill.

## What Florida Does NOT Offer (And Why It Still Works Out)

Let's be upfront about what Florida lacks compared to some other states:

- **No state solar tax credit.** States like South Carolina offer a 25% state tax credit on top of the federal ITC. Florida does not.
- **No state cash rebates or grants.** Some states and utilities offer per-watt rebates ($0.50-$1.00/watt) that reduce system costs further. Florida has no statewide program like this.
- **No Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs).** In states like New Jersey or Massachusetts, homeowners earn tradeable certificates worth hundreds of dollars per year. Florida does not participate in an SREC market.

So why is Florida still one of the best states for solar? Three reasons:

1. **Unbeatable sunshine.** More sun means more energy production, which means faster payback regardless of incentive levels.
2. **Rising electricity costs.** Florida electric rates have been climbing steadily, making the savings from solar more valuable every year.
3. **Strong consumer protections.** The Florida Solar Rights Act prevents HOAs from blocking solar installations, ensuring every homeowner has the right to go solar.

The combination of abundant sunlight, meaningful tax exemptions, the federal ITC, and rising utility rates gives most Florida homeowners a solar payback period of 7-10 years, with 15-20 additional years of essentially free electricity after that.

## How to Maximize Your Florida Solar Savings

Ready to get the most out of every incentive? Here is a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Get an Accurate System Quote

Start with a detailed proposal that accounts for your roof size, energy usage, shading, and local utility rates. The right system size matters because oversizing wastes money and undersizing leaves savings on the table. [Request a free quote from RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com) to see exactly what your home needs.

### 2. Confirm the Sales Tax Exemption Is Applied

Review your solar contract to make sure Florida's 6% sales tax exemption is reflected. You should not see any state sales tax line item for equipment costs. If you do, ask your installer to correct it.

### 3. Claim the Federal ITC Correctly

Work with a tax professional to file IRS Form 5695 with your federal return in the year your system is placed in service. If you cannot use the full credit in one year, carry the remainder forward.

### 4. Notify Your County Property Appraiser

After installation, contact your county property appraiser's office to ensure the solar property tax exemption is applied. Do not assume it happens automatically. A quick phone call or form submission protects you from an unexpected tax increase.

### 5. Consider Battery Storage

Adding a home battery like the Tesla Powerwall or Enphase IQ Battery does more than provide backup power during Florida's hurricane season. Battery storage qualifies for the same 30% federal ITC and Florida sales tax exemption, making it significantly more affordable.

### 6. Choose an Installer You Can Trust for 25 Years

Solar is a long-term investment, and the company you choose matters. Look for an installer with in-house crews (not subcontractors), strong warranty coverage, proper licensing, and a track record in Florida. At RIV Solar, we offer a 25-year warranty, use our own installation teams, and provide bilingual support to serve Florida's diverse communities.
