# Solar Is Not for Everyone — How to Know If It's Right for You (FL Edition)

**Solar panels are a smart financial move for most Florida homeowners, but not all of them. Whether solar is right for you depends on your roof condition, sun exposure, electric bill size, how long you plan to stay in your home, and your financial goals. At RIV Solar, we believe honesty about who should and should not go solar is the foundation of a relationship worth having.**

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Solar is an excellent investment for the majority of Florida homeowners**, but specific factors like heavy tree shading, a roof that needs replacement, plans to move within two years, or electric bills under $80 per month can make it the wrong move at the wrong time.
- **The best candidates for solar in Florida have monthly FPL or Duke Energy bills above $120, a roof in good condition with strong south- or west-facing exposure**, and plan to stay in their home for at least five years.
- **RIV Solar's core philosophy is "let the numbers speak"** — if the math does not work for your situation, we will tell you, because a customer we turn away today trusts us enough to refer us tomorrow.
- **Beware of solar companies that tell every homeowner they are a perfect candidate** — a company unwilling to say "no" is a company more interested in their commission than your outcome.
- **Many situations that seem like dealbreakers are actually solvable** — a roof that needs repair, partial shading, or an unusual electrical setup may just require the right design approach, not a hard pass on solar altogether.

## Why We Are Writing This (And Why Most Solar Companies Never Would)

Here is something you will almost never hear from a solar company: **not everyone should go solar.**

That sentence probably feels strange coming from a business that installs solar panels for a living. It should feel strange. The entire solar industry is built on convincing every homeowner that panels on their roof are an automatic win. Salespeople are trained to overcome objections, not validate them. Commission structures reward closed deals, not honest conversations.

At RIV Solar, we operate differently. Our core philosophy is simple: **solar is not for everyone — we let the numbers speak.**

That is not a marketing slogan. It is how we run every single consultation. If the numbers work, we will show you exactly how and why. If the numbers do not work, we will tell you that too — and explain what would need to change for solar to make sense in the future.

### Why Honesty Is Better Business

You might wonder why a solar company would voluntarily turn away potential customers. The answer is straightforward: because the alternative is worse.

A homeowner who goes solar when they should not have — because a salesperson oversold the savings, ignored a shading problem, or glossed over a roof that needed replacement first — becomes an unhappy customer. They leave bad reviews. They warn their neighbors. They create the exact kind of distrust that makes the next homeowner hesitant to even consider solar.

A homeowner we tell the truth to, even when that truth is "solar is not your best move right now," becomes our most powerful advocate. They trust us. They remember us. And when their situation changes — or when their neighbor asks for a recommendation — they send people our way.

Radical transparency is not charity. It is the smartest long-term business strategy we know.

## When Solar IS Right for You: The Florida Checklist

For the majority of Florida homeowners, solar panels are a genuinely excellent financial decision. Here is how to know if you fall into that category.

### Your Monthly Electric Bill Is Above $120

This is the single most important factor. Solar savings are directly proportional to how much you currently spend on electricity. If your FPL or Duke Energy bill regularly exceeds $120 per month — and for many Florida families it exceeds $200 to $300 during summer — you have a strong financial case for solar.

The higher your bill, the faster your payback period and the greater your lifetime savings. A homeowner paying $250 per month to FPL stands to save $60,000 to $90,000 over 25 years with a properly designed system.

### Your Roof Is in Good Condition

Solar panels last 25 to 30 years. If your roof has 15 or more years of life remaining, you are in excellent shape. If your roof is relatively new — say, replaced within the last 10 years — you are in the ideal position.

A good roof means:

- **No active leaks or structural damage**
- **Shingles, tiles, or metal in solid condition** with no widespread cracking, curling, or missing sections
- **Adequate structural integrity** to support the added weight of panels and racking (virtually all Florida roofs meet this standard)

### You Have Good Sun Exposure

Florida is called the Sunshine State for a reason. Most homes here receive excellent solar irradiance. But "most" does not mean "all." The ideal solar home has:

- **A south-facing roof section** (the gold standard for solar production in the Northern Hemisphere)
- **A west-facing roof section** (the second-best option, capturing strong afternoon sun)
- **Minimal shading from trees, neighboring buildings, or other obstructions** during peak production hours (roughly 9 AM to 4 PM)

East-facing roofs can also work well in Florida, particularly when combined with a battery storage system. North-facing roofs are the only orientation that typically does not pencil out — and even then, a qualified designer may find workable solutions depending on roof pitch and available square footage.

### You Plan to Stay in Your Home for Five or More Years

The average solar payback period in Florida is six to nine years. If you plan to stay in your home for at least five years, you will recover a significant portion of your investment even before hitting full payback — and the increase in home value that solar provides means you recoup value at sale.

Homeowners who plan to stay 10 years or longer are in the sweet spot. After your system pays for itself, every kilowatt-hour it produces is essentially free electricity for the remaining 15 to 20 years of the panel warranty.

### You Want to Lock In Your Energy Costs

FPL and Duke Energy have raised rates by 3% to 5% per year over the past decade, and there is no indication that trend will reverse. If you are the kind of person who prefers financial predictability — knowing what your energy costs will be next year, in five years, in fifteen years — solar gives you that.

Once your system is installed, your production is locked in. The sun does not send rate increase notices.

### You Want Hurricane Resilience

If you add a battery storage system alongside your solar panels, you gain something no utility can offer: **the ability to keep your home powered when the grid goes down.** In a state where hurricane season runs six months of every year, that is not a luxury — it is a strategic decision.

A solar-plus-battery system can keep your refrigerator, lights, medical devices, internet, and even your air conditioning running during multi-day outages that affect millions of Floridians every hurricane season.

## When Solar Might NOT Be Right for You: An Honest Assessment

This is the section most solar companies will never write. We think it is the most important one.

### Your Electric Bill Is Consistently Below $80 Per Month

If you are paying less than $80 per month for electricity, the savings from solar may not be large enough to justify the investment. This is uncommon in Florida — the average residential bill is well above that — but it does happen, particularly for:

- Small homes or condos with minimal square footage
- Snowbirds who spend several months per year elsewhere
- Exceptionally energy-efficient homes with newer HVAC systems and appliances

In these cases, the math simply does not work in your favor. A solar system costs the same to install whether your bill is $80 or $280, but the returns are dramatically different.

**Our advice:** If your bills are this low, you are already doing something right. Solar may become viable in the future as utility rates continue to climb, but right now, the payback timeline is likely too long to recommend.

### Your Roof Needs Replacement Within the Next Few Years

Installing solar panels on a roof that will need replacement in three to five years is a mistake. When the roof is replaced, the panels must be removed, stored, and reinstalled — a process called a "lift and relay" that costs $3,000 to $8,000 depending on system size and roof type.

**Our advice:** Replace your roof first, then go solar. In fact, this can work in your favor — you can coordinate the roof replacement and solar installation together, sometimes qualifying for combined financing and ensuring your new roof is optimally designed for panel placement.

### Heavy, Unresolvable Tree Shading

If mature trees cast dense shade across your entire roof during peak sun hours and you are unwilling (or unable, due to local ordinances or personal preference) to remove or trim them, solar production will be severely compromised.

Modern microinverter technology has made solar panels far more shade-tolerant than they were a decade ago — a shaded panel no longer drags down the entire array. But there is a difference between partial shading on a few panels and a canopy that blocks 60% or more of your roof from direct sunlight.

**Our advice:** Request a shade analysis. Sometimes the shading is not as bad as it looks from the ground, and a well-designed system can still deliver strong returns. But if the analysis shows severe obstruction, we will tell you.

### You Are Planning to Move Within Two Years

If you are selling your home within the next 24 months, solar can still add value — studies consistently show that solar homes sell for a premium of $10,000 to $20,000 or more. But the logistics of selling a home with a solar system (especially a leased or financed one) can add complexity to the transaction.

**Our advice:** If you are moving within two years, the better play may be to wait and go solar on your next home, where you will enjoy the full payback period and lifetime savings.

## The Gray Areas: Situations That Need a Closer Look

Not every home falls neatly into the "yes" or "no" category. Many fall somewhere in between — and these are the situations where the quality of your solar consultation matters most.

### Your Roof Is 10 to 15 Years Old

This is the most common gray area. Your roof is not new, but it is not failing either. The question is whether it has enough remaining life to justify installing a 25-year solar system on top of it.

A qualified solar company will evaluate your roof's condition — not just its age — and give you an honest assessment. Some 15-year-old roofs are in excellent shape. Some 10-year-old roofs have taken a beating from Florida storms. Age alone does not tell the full story.

### You Have Partial Shading

Maybe one section of your roof gets good sun while another is shaded by a large oak tree. This does not automatically disqualify you. A skilled system designer can work around partial shading by placing panels only on the unobstructed sections and sizing the system to maximize production on the available space.

The key question is whether the unshaded area is large enough to accommodate a system that offsets a meaningful percentage of your electric bill. If we can design a system that covers 70% to 80% of your usage on the available roof space, it is usually still a strong investment.

### You Have an Unusual Roof Layout

Flat commercial-style roofs, multiple small roof faces, dormers, skylights, vent pipes, and other obstructions reduce the usable area for panels. These are not dealbreakers, but they do require more creative system design — and not every installer has the engineering capability to handle them well.

### Your Electrical Panel Is Outdated

Homes with older electrical panels (100 amps or less) may need a panel upgrade before solar can be installed. This adds $1,500 to $3,000 to the project cost. It is not a reason to skip solar, but it is a cost that should be disclosed upfront and factored into your ROI calculation.

### You Have an HOA

Florida law (Section 163.04, Florida Statutes) prohibits HOAs from banning solar panels outright. However, some HOAs attempt to impose restrictions on placement, aesthetics, or approval timelines. A good solar company knows the law, handles HOA communications on your behalf, and does not let an overreaching board derail a project that is your legal right.

## How to Evaluate Your Situation: A Step-by-Step Approach

If you are reading this and genuinely trying to figure out whether solar is right for your Florida home, here is the process we recommend:

### Step 1: Look at Your Last 12 Months of Electric Bills

Pull up your FPL or Duke Energy account online and look at your monthly usage for the full year. Note the highs (summer), the lows (winter), and the average. If your annual average is above $120 per month, you are likely a strong candidate.

### Step 2: Assess Your Roof Honestly

Walk outside and look at your roof. Is it in visibly good condition? Do you know approximately when it was last replaced? If you are unsure, any reputable solar company will inspect it during the consultation process — and an honest one will tell you if replacement should come first.

### Step 3: Check Your Sun Exposure

Stand in your yard around noon on a sunny day and observe how much of your roof is in direct sunlight versus shade. Pay particular attention to the south- and west-facing sections. This is not a precise measurement — the solar company's shade analysis tools will provide that — but it gives you a general sense.

### Step 4: Consider Your Timeline

How long do you realistically plan to stay in this home? Five years? Ten? Twenty? The longer your timeline, the more solar savings you capture. But even five years delivers meaningful value in most cases.

### Step 5: Get a Consultation — But From the Right Company

This is where the process either works or falls apart. The quality of your consultation determines whether you get an honest assessment or a sales pitch. More on this below.

---

## What a Good Solar Consultation Looks Like

A legitimate solar consultation is an evaluation, not a sales presentation. Here is what you should expect from a company that takes your interests seriously.

### They Ask More Questions Than They Answer

A good consultant spends the first 15 to 20 minutes understanding your situation: your electric bills, your roof age, your energy usage patterns, your timeline, your financial goals. If the salesperson launches into a pitch within the first five minutes, they are not evaluating — they are selling.

### They Show You Actual Numbers

You should see a detailed production estimate based on satellite imagery of your specific roof, a financial projection showing year-by-year savings, a clear breakdown of costs including any dealer fees or financing charges, and the specific payback timeline for your system.

If the numbers are vague — "you'll save thousands" — that is not a consultation. That is a brochure.

### They Tell You What They Cannot Do

An honest company will tell you if your roof is not ideal, if shading will reduce production, if your bill is too low to justify the investment, or if you should wait and address something else first. This is the single clearest indicator of a company that prioritizes your outcome over their revenue.

### They Give You Time to Decide

A solar system is a 25-year investment. Any company that tells you the price is "only good today" or that you need to "sign before the tax credit expires this month" is using manufactured urgency to bypass your judgment.

At RIV Solar, we give every homeowner the time and information they need to make a confident decision. If it takes a week, a month, or six months — fine. The sun will still be there.

## Red Flags From Pushy Solar Companies

Florida's booming solar market has attracted companies that prioritize volume over integrity. Protect yourself by watching for these warning signs:

### "Every Home Qualifies!"

No, they do not. Any company that tells every homeowner they are a perfect candidate is either lying or not bothering to evaluate. Both are unacceptable.

### "This Price Expires Today"

Solar panel prices do not expire overnight. The federal tax credit has a published legislative timeline. Any urgency that evaporates if you ask to sleep on it was never real in the first place.

### "You Will Eliminate Your Electric Bill Completely"

This is technically possible in some cases, but most well-designed systems offset 80% to 100% of your usage. You will still have a small monthly connection fee to your utility (typically $10 to $15). Any company promising "zero electric bills" without qualifying that statement is misleading you.

### They Will Not Show You the Dealer Fee

Many solar loans include a 15% to 30% dealer fee embedded in the loan balance. This is not inherently wrong — it is how many solar financing products work — but a company that hides it or refuses to discuss it openly is a company that does not respect your ability to make an informed decision.

### They Discourage You From Getting Other Quotes

A confident company welcomes comparison. If a salesperson pressures you not to shop around, ask yourself what they are afraid you will find.

### They Have No Local Presence

Solar is a 25-year relationship. If the company has no physical office in Florida, no local installation crews, and no track record in your community, your warranty is only as strong as their willingness to answer the phone in 2035.

## Our Promise: We Will Tell You the Truth

At RIV Solar, we make a commitment to every Florida homeowner we speak with:

**If solar makes sense for your home, we will show you exactly why — with real numbers, transparent pricing, and a system designed specifically for your roof, your usage, and your goals.**

**If solar does not make sense for your home right now, we will tell you that too — and explain what would need to change for it to become a strong investment in the future.**

We do not need every homeowner to say yes. We need every homeowner to trust us. Because trust is what builds a company that lasts 25 years — the same length as the warranty we put on every system we install.

Here is what that looks like in practice:

- **$0 down financing** so cost is not a barrier for qualified homeowners
- **25-year comprehensive warranty** backed by our company, not just the manufacturer
- **In-house installation crews** — no subcontractors, no finger-pointing if something needs attention
- **Bilingual team** (English and Spanish) because every homeowner deserves a consultation in the language they are most comfortable in
- **A consultation that is an evaluation**, not a pitch

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if solar is worth it for my Florida home?

The most reliable way to determine if solar is worth it for your Florida home is to compare your average monthly electric bill against the projected monthly cost of a solar system. If your FPL or Duke Energy bill consistently exceeds $120 per month, your roof is in good condition with decent sun exposure, and you plan to stay in your home for at least five years, solar will almost certainly deliver a positive return on investment. A reputable installer will show you the specific numbers for your home — not just generic estimates.

### What electric bill is too low for solar panels in Florida?

If your monthly electric bill is consistently below $80, solar panels may not generate enough savings to justify the investment at current pricing. The savings from solar are directly tied to how much you currently pay for electricity — a small bill means a longer payback period and lower lifetime returns. That said, if your bills are low now but you anticipate adding an electric vehicle, a pool, or other high-draw appliances, your future usage may make solar a strong play.

### Can I get solar panels if my roof is old?

You can, but you need to be strategic about it. If your roof has fewer than 10 years of remaining life, the smarter approach is to replace the roof first and then install solar on the new surface. Installing panels on an aging roof means paying $3,000 to $8,000 later to remove and reinstall them when the roof eventually needs replacement. A reputable solar company will inspect your roof and give you an honest assessment of whether it makes sense to proceed now or wait.

### Should I get solar if I am planning to sell my house?

It depends on your timeline. If you are selling within the next one to two years, the logistics of transferring a solar system (especially a financed one) can add complexity to the transaction, and you may not recoup the full investment. If you are staying for three or more years, solar adds measurable resale value — studies show solar homes in Florida sell for $10,000 to $20,000 more on average — and you benefit from reduced energy costs in the interim.

### How can I tell if a solar company is being honest with me?

An honest solar company asks about your situation before presenting solutions, shows you detailed financial projections specific to your home, discloses all costs including dealer fees and financing terms, and is willing to tell you if solar is not a good fit. Red flags include high-pressure closing tactics, prices that "expire today," claims that every home qualifies, and reluctance to show you the full cost breakdown. The simplest test: if they seem more interested in closing a deal than understanding your needs, walk away.
