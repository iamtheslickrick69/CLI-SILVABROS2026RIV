# SDG&E Has the Highest Rates in America: How to Fight Back

**The short answer: SDG&E customers pay 55¢ per kWh—the highest electricity rate in the continental United States.** The average household bill exceeds $385/month, with summer bills often hitting $500-600. There's no relief coming. But there IS a way to fight back: generate your own power. Here's the full breakdown.

## SDG&E Rates: By the Numbers

Let's put San Diego Gas & Electric's rates in perspective:

### 2026 Average Rates Comparison:

| Utility | Rate per kWh | National Ranking |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **SDG&E** | **55¢** | **#1 (Highest)** |
| PG&E | 45¢ | #2 |
| SCE | 42¢ | #3 |
| Hawaii Electric | 40¢ | #4 |
| National Average | 16¢ | — |

**SDG&E customers pay more than 3x the national average.**

### What That Means Monthly:

| Monthly Usage | SDG&E Cost | National Average Cost |
|---------------|------------|----------------------|
| 500 kWh | $275 | $80 |
| 700 kWh | $385 | $112 |
| 1,000 kWh | $550 | $160 |
| 1,500 kWh | $825 | $240 |

A family using 700 kWh/month—fairly average for San Diego County—pays **$3,000+ more per year** than the national average.

## Why SDG&E Rates Are So Extreme

### 1. San Diego's Geography

SDG&E serves a challenging territory:
- Coastal areas to mountainous backcountry
- High fire-risk zones throughout
- Limited space for local power generation
- Long transmission distances

Building and maintaining infrastructure in this terrain is expensive.

### 2. Wildfire Liability

SDG&E equipment has been blamed for devastating fires:
- 2007 Witch Creek Fire (2 deaths, 1,100+ homes destroyed)
- Multiple subsequent fires in the backcountry

The utility now spends hundreds of millions on:
- Undergrounding power lines
- Fire detection systems
- Vegetation management
- Insurance and legal reserves

These costs go directly to ratepayers.

### 3. Smaller Customer Base

SDG&E has fewer customers (3.6 million) than PG&E (16 million) or SCE (15 million). Fixed infrastructure costs spread across fewer ratepayers = higher per-customer rates.

### 4. Aggressive Clean Energy Goals

San Diego has ambitious climate targets. SDG&E is:
- Building new renewable infrastructure
- Installing grid-scale batteries
- Upgrading transmission for renewable sources

All necessary and worthwhile—but expensive.

### 5. No Competition

SDG&E is a regulated monopoly. You can't switch to a competitor. Your only choices are:
- Pay whatever they charge
- Generate your own power

---

## SDG&E's Time-of-Use Rate Structure

SDG&E uses Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing that makes peak hours brutally expensive:

### TOU-DR1 Schedule (Typical Residential):

| Period | Summer Hours | Summer Rate | Winter Rate |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Super Off-Peak | 12 AM - 6 AM | 45¢ | 42¢ |
| Off-Peak | 6 AM - 4 PM, 9 PM - 12 AM | 50¢ | 48¢ |
| Peak | 4 PM - 9 PM | 65-75¢ | 55-60¢ |

**Peak hours (4-9 PM) cost 65-75¢ per kWh in summer.**

This is exactly when most families:
- Return home from work
- Run air conditioning
- Cook dinner
- Use TVs, computers, devices

Without solar + battery, you're trapped paying the highest rates during the hours you actually need electricity.

## The Trajectory: It's Getting Worse

SDG&E rate history and projections:

| Year | Average Rate | % Above 2020 |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| 2020 | 35¢ | — |
| 2022 | 42¢ | +20% |
| 2024 | 50¢ | +43% |
| 2026 | 55¢ | +57% |
| 2028 (projected) | 62¢ | +77% |
| 2030 (projected) | 70¢ | +100% |

**By 2030, average households could face $600-800/month electric bills.**

## SDG&E Territory: Where You Pay the Most

These communities are served by SDG&E and face the highest electricity costs in America:

**San Diego County:**
- San Diego
- Chula Vista
- Oceanside
- Escondido
- Carlsbad
- El Cajon
- Vista
- Encinitas
- La Mesa
- Santee
- Poway
- All unincorporated areas

**Southern Riverside County:**

## How to Fight Back: Your Options

### Option 1: Community Choice Aggregation (CCA)

San Diego Community Power launched in 2021, offering an alternative power source while still using SDG&E's grid.

**Pros:** Cleaner energy, slightly lower generation costs
**Cons:** Still uses SDG&E distribution (where biggest costs are), still subject to most increases, no blackout protection

**Savings:** 1-3¢/kWh on generation portion only—doesn't solve the fundamental problem.

### Option 2: Aggressive Conservation

Reduce usage through efficiency improvements:
- LED lighting throughout
- Energy Star appliances
- Smart thermostat optimization
- Weatherization and insulation

**Reality:** You might reduce usage 15-20%, but rates increase 10% annually. You're running in place at best.

### Option 3: Go Solar

Generate your own electricity and bypass SDG&E's rates entirely.

**The SDG&E solar advantage:** Because rates are so high, solar payback is faster than anywhere else in California.

## Solar Economics in SDG&E Territory: The Best ROI in America

High rates = fast payback. Let's look at the numbers:

### Scenario: SDG&E customer with $385/month bill

**System Details:**
- Size needed: 8 kW
- Gross cost: $25,600
- 30% federal tax credit: -$7,680
- Net cost: $17,920

**Payback Calculation:**
- Annual electricity savings: $4,620 (385 × 12)
- Simple payback: **3.9 years**

Compare to other utilities:
| Utility | Same System Size | Payback Period |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **SDG&E** | 8 kW | **3.9 years** |
| PG&E | 8 kW | 5.2 years |
| SCE | 8 kW | 5.8 years |
| National Average | 8 kW | 8-10 years |

**SDG&E customers have the fastest solar payback in the country** because you're offsetting the highest rates.

### 25-Year Comparison:

| Scenario | Total Cost |
|----------|-----------|
| Stay with SDG&E (with rate increases) | $185,000+ |
| Go solar (after payback) | $25,000 (system cost) |
| **Savings** | **$160,000+** |

## Why Battery Storage Is Essential in SDG&E Territory

### 1. Peak Rate Avoidance

SDG&E's peak rates (65-75¢/kWh) are brutal. With a battery:
- Store solar energy during the day
- Use it during peak hours (4-9 PM)
- Pay nothing instead of 75¢/kWh

### 2. NEM 3.0 Optimization

Under NEM 3.0, excess solar sent to the grid earns reduced credits. In SDG&E territory:
- Export credit: ~5-8¢/kWh
- Avoided cost (using your own solar): 55-75¢/kWh

**Storing and using your own power is worth 10x more than exporting it.**

### 3. Outage Protection

San Diego County has:
- PSPS (Public Safety Power Shutoffs) in fire-prone areas
- Santa Ana wind events causing outages
- Increasing grid strain during heat waves

A battery keeps your home running when the grid fails.

### 4. True Energy Independence

With solar + battery, you're genuinely independent. SDG&E's rates, policies, and outages become irrelevant.

## SDG&E's Response: They Don't Want You to Leave

SDG&E loses revenue when customers go solar. You'll notice:
- Marketing emphasizing "grid reliability"
- Lobbying for less-favorable solar policies
- Monthly "service charges" that don't go away with solar

**What they can't do:** Stop you from going solar. California law protects your right to generate your own electricity. SDG&E must interconnect your system.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is SDG&E allowed to charge so much?
SDG&E is a regulated monopoly. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approves rate increases for infrastructure costs, wildfire prevention, and clean energy mandates. Customers have no alternatives within the system.

### Can I switch to a different utility?
No. Utility territories are fixed. If you live in SDG&E territory, you're stuck with them—unless you generate your own power.

### How much can I really save with solar?
SDG&E customers with $385/month bills typically reduce to $10-15/month (connection fees only). Annual savings: $4,400+. Lifetime savings: $100,000-180,000.

### Is solar worth it with SDG&E's high rates even under NEM 3.0?
Absolutely. NEM 3.0 reduced export credits, but SDG&E's astronomical rates mean avoiding those rates is incredibly valuable. Battery storage maximizes this value.

### What if I can't afford the upfront cost?
$0-down financing options mean your monthly solar payment is typically lower than your current SDG&E bill. You start saving immediately with no money out of pocket.

### How long does installation take?
Physical installation: 1-2 days. Total process including permits and SDG&E approval: 6-10 weeks.
