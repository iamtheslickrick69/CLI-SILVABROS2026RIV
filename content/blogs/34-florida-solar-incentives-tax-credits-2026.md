# Florida Solar Incentives & Tax Credits 2026: Complete Guide

**Florida offers some of the best solar incentives in the nation.** Between federal tax credits, state exemptions, and net metering, you can reduce your solar investment by 30-40% while locking in decades of savings.

Here's every Florida solar incentive available in 2026.

## Federal Solar Tax Credit (ITC)

The biggest incentive is the federal Investment Tax Credit:

| Year | Tax Credit |
|------|------------|
| 2024-2032 | **30%** |
| 2033 | 26% |
| 2034 | 22% |
| 2035+ | 0% (expires) |

### How It Works

The ITC is a **dollar-for-dollar reduction** in your federal income tax:

- System cost: $25,000
- 30% credit: $7,500
- Your federal tax bill: Reduced by $7,500

**Important:** This is a *credit*, not a deduction. It directly reduces what you owe.

### Who Qualifies

- You must own the system (not lease)
- You must have federal tax liability
- System must be installed on your primary or secondary residence
- New systems only (not used equipment)

### Carryover Rules

If your tax credit exceeds your tax liability:
- Unused credit carries forward to future years
- No annual limit on how much you can claim
- Credit can be applied until fully used

## Florida Property Tax Exemption

**100% exemption** on the added value of solar:

- Solar increases home value by ~4%
- That added value is NOT taxed in Florida
- Saves hundreds of dollars annually for life of system

### Example

| Factor | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Home value before solar | $400,000 |
| Solar system value | $25,000 |
| Home value after solar | $425,000 |
| Taxable value | $400,000 (unchanged) |
| Annual tax savings | $500+ |

## Florida Sales Tax Exemption

**Full exemption** from Florida's 6% sales tax on solar equipment:

- Panels, inverters, batteries: No sales tax
- Mounting hardware: No sales tax
- Installation labor: Already tax-exempt in FL

### Savings Example

- System cost: $25,000
- Normal sales tax (6%): $1,500
- With exemption: $0
- **You save: $1,500**

## Net Metering

Florida utilities offer **full retail net metering**:

| Utility | Net Metering Rate |
|---------|-------------------|
| FPL | 1:1 retail |
| Duke Energy | 1:1 retail |
| TECO | 1:1 retail |
| JEA | 1:1 retail |

### How Net Metering Saves You Money

1. Panels produce excess during day
2. Excess flows to grid
3. Utility credits you at full retail rate
4. Use credits at night/cloudy days
5. Pay only for net usage

This is more valuable than California's NEM 3.0, which only pays ~25% of retail for exports.

## PACE Financing (Property Assessed Clean Energy)

Florida offers PACE financing for solar:

- **No upfront cost**
- **No credit check** (secured by property)
- **Payments via property tax bill**
- **Transfers with home sale**

Counties with PACE programs:
- Miami-Dade
- Broward
- Palm Beach
- Orange
- Hillsborough
- Many others

## Solar Rebates by Utility

Some Florida utilities offer additional rebates:

| Utility | Rebate | Details |
|---------|--------|---------|
| JEA | $2,000 | One-time rebate for solar |
| OUC | $1,000 | Orlando customers |
| Gainesville Regional | $500/kW | Up to $2,500 total |

*Note: Rebates change frequently. Confirm current availability.*

## Total Savings Stack-Up

Here's how Florida incentives combine:

| Incentive | Typical Savings |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 30% Federal Tax Credit | $7,500 |
| Sales Tax Exemption | $1,500 |
| Property Tax Exemption | $500/year |
| Net Metering (25 years) | $45,000+ |
| **Total Value** | **$54,500+** |

## Compare: Florida vs. California Incentives

| Incentive | Florida | California |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Federal Tax Credit | 30% | 30% |
| Net Metering | 1:1 retail | ~25% retail (NEM 3.0) |
| Property Tax Exempt | Yes | Yes |
| Sales Tax Exempt | Yes | No |
| State Tax Credit | N/A (no income tax) | No |

Florida's incentive package is actually more valuable for most homeowners because net metering remains at full retail rates.

## How to Claim Your Incentives

### Federal Tax Credit

1. Install solar system
2. Keep all receipts and contracts
3. Complete IRS Form 5695
4. File with your federal tax return
5. Receive credit against taxes owed

## The Timeline Matters

**2026 is an excellent year to go solar in Florida:**

- 30% federal credit still available
- Net metering policy stable
- Utility rates rising 5-7% annually
- Equipment costs at historic lows

After 2032, the federal credit drops to 26%, then 22%, then expires entirely.

## The Bottom Line
