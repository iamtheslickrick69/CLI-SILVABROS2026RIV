# What Is PACE Financing? Solar Loans for Florida Homeowners

**PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) financing lets Florida homeowners fund a solar panel installation with no money down and no credit score requirement. Instead of a traditional loan, the balance is repaid through your annual property tax bill. It is one of several $0-down pathways Florida residents can use to go solar, alongside solar loans, leases, and power purchase agreements.**

## Key Takeaways

- **PACE financing attaches to the property, not the borrower**, and is repaid through your property tax bill over 10 to 25 years.
- **No credit score minimum is required** for PACE approval, making it one of the most accessible solar financing options in Florida.
- **The SELF (Solar and Energy Loan Fund)** is a Florida-based nonprofit lender that offers low-interest solar loans as an alternative or complement to PACE.
- **PACE-financed solar systems still qualify for the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)**, which can dramatically lower your net cost.
- **Comparing PACE to traditional solar loans** is essential because interest rates, lien priority, and resale implications differ significantly between the two.

## What Is PACE Financing?

PACE stands for **Property Assessed Clean Energy**. It is a government-enabled financing program that allows homeowners to fund energy-efficient upgrades, including solar panel systems, through a voluntary assessment on their property tax bill.

Unlike a personal loan or a credit card, PACE financing is tied to the **property itself** rather than the individual homeowner. That distinction matters for several reasons, which we will cover in detail below.

PACE programs were created to remove the most common barriers to clean energy adoption: high upfront costs and strict lending requirements. Florida is one of the most active PACE markets in the country, thanks to abundant sunshine, rising electricity costs, and supportive state legislation that authorizes residential PACE programs statewide.

### A Brief History of PACE in Florida

Florida formally authorized residential PACE financing in 2010. Since then, multiple PACE providers have entered the market, giving homeowners several options to compare. Programs like Ygrene, Florida PACE Funding Agency, and Renew Financial have facilitated thousands of solar installations across the state.

The key legislative framework is found in **Florida Statute 163.08**, which allows counties and municipalities to establish PACE programs for renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements.

## How Does PACE Financing Work in Florida?

The mechanics of PACE are straightforward once you understand the basic structure. Here is the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Confirm Eligibility

You must own the property where the solar system will be installed. The property must be located in a county or municipality that participates in a PACE program. The vast majority of Florida counties do participate, but it is worth confirming before you move forward.

### Step 2: Choose a Contractor

You select a licensed, PACE-approved solar installer. This is where working with an experienced company matters. [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com) is familiar with the PACE process in Florida and can help you navigate the paperwork from start to finish.

### Step 3: Get Approved

PACE approval is based on the **property**, not your personal credit score. The main requirements are:

- You must be current on your property taxes.
- You must be current on your mortgage (no late payments in the past three years, generally).
- The property cannot be in bankruptcy proceedings.
- You must have sufficient equity in the home.

### Step 4: Installation

Once approved, your solar installer completes the installation. The PACE provider pays the contractor directly.

### Step 5: Repayment Through Property Taxes

The financed amount appears as a **non-ad valorem assessment** on your annual property tax bill. You repay it over a term of 10, 15, 20, or 25 years, depending on the program and the amount financed.

Interest is included in the assessment, so your annual payment covers both principal and financing costs.

## Pros and Cons of PACE Financing for Solar

No financing option is perfect for every homeowner. Understanding the advantages and drawbacks of PACE will help you make a more informed decision.

### Pros of PACE Financing

**No credit score requirement.** This is the single biggest differentiator. If your credit history has prevented you from qualifying for a traditional solar loan, PACE may be your best path to going solar.

**$0 down.** PACE covers 100% of the project cost, including equipment, labor, and permitting. You do not need to write a check at signing.

**Long repayment terms.** With terms up to 25 years, monthly costs can be spread thin enough to produce immediate savings on your electricity bill.

**Transferable with the property.** If you sell your home, the remaining PACE balance can transfer to the new owner, since it is attached to the property. This can simplify the sales process in some cases.

**Immediate energy savings.** Because there is no waiting period, you start generating electricity and reducing your utility bill as soon as the system is operational.

### Cons of PACE Financing

**Higher interest rates.** PACE interest rates typically range from 6% to 9%, which is often higher than what you would pay with a traditional solar loan or home equity line of credit.

**Property tax lien priority.** The PACE assessment sits in a senior lien position, ahead of your mortgage. Some mortgage lenders view this unfavorably, and it can complicate refinancing or selling your home in certain situations.

**Mortgage lender consent may be required.** Under federal guidelines, some lenders require written consent before a PACE assessment is placed on the property. This extra step can delay the process.

**Not a personal tax deduction.** Unlike mortgage interest, PACE interest payments are generally not deductible on your federal income tax return. However, the 30% federal ITC still applies to the cost of the solar system itself.

**Penalties for non-payment.** Because PACE is tied to your property tax bill, failure to pay can result in the same consequences as unpaid property taxes, including potential liens and foreclosure.

## What Is the SELF Program? Florida's Nonprofit Solar Lender

If PACE does not feel like the right fit, Florida homeowners have another distinctive option: the **Solar and Energy Loan Fund**, commonly known as **SELF**.

SELF is a **nonprofit Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI)** based in Florida. It was created specifically to help homeowners, including low-to-moderate income households, finance solar installations and energy efficiency upgrades.

### How SELF Differs From PACE

| Feature | PACE | SELF |
|---|---|---|
| **Repayment method** | Property tax bill | Monthly loan payments |
| **Credit score required** | No | Flexible (considers alternative factors) |
| **Interest rates** | 6%-9% typical | Often lower than PACE |
| **Lien type** | Property tax lien (senior) | Standard loan lien |
| **Mortgage lender consent** | Sometimes required | Typically not required |
| **Nonprofit status** | No (most PACE providers are private) | Yes |

### Why Consider SELF?

SELF is designed with accessibility in mind. It evaluates applicants using a broader set of criteria than traditional lenders, including utility payment history and rental history. Its mission is to expand clean energy access to communities that are often underserved by mainstream financial products.

If you are interested in exploring SELF as a financing option, the team at [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com) can walk you through how it compares to PACE and other options for your specific situation.

## PACE vs. Traditional Solar Loans: Which Is Better?

This is the question most Florida homeowners wrestle with. The honest answer is: it depends on your financial profile.

### When PACE Makes More Sense

- **Your credit score is below 650** and you cannot qualify for a competitive solar loan.
- **You want zero out-of-pocket cost** and are comfortable with a higher interest rate in exchange for accessibility.
- **You plan to sell the home** within a few years and want the assessment to transfer to the next owner.

### When a Traditional Solar Loan Makes More Sense

- **Your credit score is 680 or above**, qualifying you for interest rates in the 4% to 7% range.
- **You want to keep your property tax bill clean** and prefer a standard monthly loan payment.
- **You are planning to refinance your mortgage soon** and do not want a senior lien complicating the process.
- **You want to deduct interest** on your tax return (possible with some home equity-based loan products).

### Interest Rate Comparison

Here is a general comparison for a $25,000 solar installation:

| Financing Option | Typical APR | Monthly Payment (20 yr) | Total Interest Paid |
|---|---|---|---|
| PACE | 7.0%-9.0% | $194-$225 | $21,500-$29,000 |
| Solar Loan (good credit) | 4.5%-6.5% | $158-$186 | $12,900-$19,600 |
| SELF (nonprofit) | 5.0%-8.0% | $165-$209 | $14,600-$25,200 |
| Home Equity Loan | 6.0%-8.5% | $179-$216 | $18,000-$26,800 |

*These are approximate ranges for illustration. Actual rates depend on your lender, term, and financial profile.*

Regardless of which financing path you choose, the **30% federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)** applies. On a $25,000 system, that is a **$7,500 tax credit** that directly reduces your federal tax liability. This credit is available whether you pay cash, use PACE, take a solar loan, or go through SELF.

## Who Qualifies for PACE Financing in Florida?

PACE qualification is intentionally broad. Here are the core requirements:

1. **You own the property.** Renters cannot apply. The property must be a single-family home, condo, townhome, or in some programs, a commercial property.
2. **The property is in a participating jurisdiction.** Most Florida counties participate, but check with your PACE provider or installer.
3. **Property taxes are current.** No delinquent property tax payments.
4. **Mortgage is current.** Generally, no late payments in the past 12 months (some programs look back three years).
5. **No active bankruptcies.** The property cannot be involved in bankruptcy proceedings.
6. **Sufficient equity.** The total of your mortgage balance plus the PACE assessment typically cannot exceed a certain percentage of your home's appraised value (often 90% to 100%).

Notice what is **not** on that list: a minimum credit score. That is the defining feature of PACE and the reason it remains popular in Florida despite higher interest rates.

## How to Apply for PACE Solar Financing in Florida

The application process is simpler than most homeowners expect. Here is a practical roadmap:

### 1. Get a Solar Quote

Start by requesting a quote from a qualified solar installer. At [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com), we provide free consultations that include system design, projected savings, and a side-by-side financing comparison so you can see exactly how PACE stacks up against other options.

### 2. Select a PACE Program

Your installer can help you identify which PACE programs operate in your area. Common Florida PACE providers include:

- **Ygrene**
- **Florida PACE Funding Agency**
- **Renew Financial (now part of Forbright)**

Each has slightly different terms, rates, and processes.

### 3. Complete the Application

Applications are typically completed online and take 15 to 30 minutes. You will need basic property information, mortgage details, and identification.

### 4. Receive Approval

Most approvals come within 24 to 48 hours. Because there is no credit pull, the process is faster than traditional lending.

### 5. Schedule Installation

Once approved, your installer schedules the work. RIV Solar uses **in-house installation crews** (never subcontractors), which gives you more control over the timeline and quality. Our bilingual team can also support Spanish-speaking homeowners through every step of the process.

### 6. Start Saving

After installation, permitting, and utility interconnection, your system goes live. You begin generating clean energy and reducing your monthly electricity costs immediately.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does PACE financing affect my credit score?

No. PACE assessments are not reported to the major credit bureaus because they are property assessments, not personal loans. However, if you fail to pay your property tax bill (which now includes the PACE amount), the resulting tax lien can eventually affect your credit.

### Can I combine PACE with the federal solar tax credit?

Yes. The 30% federal Investment Tax Credit applies to the full cost of your solar installation regardless of how you finance it. If your PACE-financed system costs $25,000, you can claim a $7,500 federal tax credit.

### What happens to PACE financing if I sell my home?

The PACE assessment is designed to transfer with the property. However, some buyers and their lenders may request that the assessment be paid off at closing. This varies by situation and should be discussed with your real estate agent before listing.

### Is PACE better than a solar lease or PPA?

It depends on your priorities. With PACE, you own the solar system and receive the federal tax credit. With a lease or PPA, a third party owns the system and you pay a monthly fee for the electricity it produces. Ownership generally provides greater long-term savings, but leases and PPAs require even less financial involvement upfront.

### How do I know if PACE is the right choice for me?

The best approach is to compare PACE side by side with other options based on your specific financial situation. RIV Solar offers free, no-pressure consultations where we lay out all available financing paths, including PACE, SELF, traditional loans, and cash purchase, so you can choose what works best for your household.

## Making the Right Financing Decision

PACE financing has opened the door to solar for thousands of Florida homeowners who might not have qualified through traditional channels. It is not the cheapest option in terms of total interest paid, but for homeowners who need accessible, $0-down financing without a credit check, it fills a real gap in the market.

The most important step is not choosing PACE or any other specific product. It is **getting accurate, personalized information** about what each option means for your home, your budget, and your long-term savings.
