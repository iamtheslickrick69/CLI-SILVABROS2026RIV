# What Happens to Solar Panels When I Sell My House?

**The short answer: Solar panels typically transfer to the buyer with the house, increasing your home's value by 4-6%.** The process depends on whether you own the system outright, have a loan, or lease. Owned systems are simplest; leased systems require buyer agreement. Here's everything you need to know.

## The Good News: Solar Adds Value

Before worrying about complications, know this:

### Solar Homes Sell for More:

| Study | Premium Found |
|-------|---------------|
| Zillow | 4.1% higher sale price |
| Lawrence Berkeley Lab | $4 per watt installed |
| National Renewable Energy Lab | $15,000 average premium |

**For a typical California home:**
- Home value: $600,000
- 4% solar premium: +$24,000
- 8 kW system value (@ $4/watt): +$32,000

Your solar investment doesn't disappear—it transfers as home equity.

### Solar Homes Sell Faster:

Studies show solar homes sell **20% faster** than comparable non-solar homes. Buyers want lower utility bills.

## Scenario 1: You Own the System Outright

**Situation:** You paid cash or finished paying off your loan.

### What Happens:

**Simple transfer:** The solar system conveys with the house, like appliances or fixtures.

### The Process:

1. **Listing:** Advertise "owned solar system" as a feature
2. **Value:** System value factored into home price
3. **Disclosure:** Provide system details to buyer
4. **Closing:** System ownership transfers with deed
5. **Utility:** Buyer contacts utility to transfer net metering

### Documents to Provide:

- System specifications (size, equipment)
- Production history (if available)
- Warranties (panel, inverter, workmanship)
- Utility net metering agreement
- Original contract and permits

### Buyer Benefits:

- No system payments
- Immediate utility savings
- Existing warranties transfer
- No installation hassle

**This is the ideal scenario**—and why buying solar (vs. leasing) is recommended.

## Scenario 2: You Have a Solar Loan

**Situation:** You financed the system and still owe money.

### What Happens:

You have two options at closing:

**Option A: Pay Off Loan from Proceeds**

1. Loan balance paid at closing from sale proceeds
2. System transfers to buyer free and clear
3. You keep any equity above the payoff

**Example:**
- Sale price: $625,000
- Mortgage balance: $400,000
- Solar loan balance: $12,000
- Your proceeds: $213,000

**Option B: Buyer Assumes Loan (Rare)**

Some solar loans allow assumption:
1. Buyer qualifies for loan assumption
2. Loan transfers to buyer's name
3. You're released from obligation

This is less common because:
- Many loans don't allow assumption
- Buyers prefer clear ownership
- Adds complexity to closing

### Best Practice:
Plan to pay off the solar loan at closing. Factor the payoff into your pricing expectations.

---

## Scenario 3: You Lease the System

**Situation:** A solar company owns the system; you make monthly payments.

### What Happens:

The buyer must agree to assume your lease—or you must buy it out.

**Option A: Lease Transfer**

1. Buyer agrees to take over lease
2. Leasing company approves buyer (credit check)
3. Lease transfers to buyer at closing
4. You're released from obligation

**Challenges:**
- Some buyers won't take on someone else's lease
- Credit approval required
- Lease terms are fixed (can't negotiate)
- May slow or complicate sale

**Option B: Lease Buyout**

1. You purchase the system from leasing company
2. System becomes owned
3. Transfers to buyer as owned asset
4. Or: You terminate lease and system is removed

**Buyout cost:** Often substantial—check your contract for buyout terms.

**Option C: System Removal (Last Resort)**

1. Leasing company removes panels
2. Roof restored (at whose cost?)
3. Home sells without solar
4. You may owe remaining lease payments

### The Lease Reality:
Leases complicate home sales. Some buyers walk away rather than assume a 15-20 year obligation they didn't choose. This is a major reason to **buy rather than lease** if possible.

---

## Scenario 4: Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)

**Situation:** Similar to lease—third party owns system, you buy power from it.

### What Happens:

Same as lease:
- Buyer assumes PPA, OR
- You buy out the PPA, OR
- System is removed

**Same complications apply.** PPAs and leases create similar challenges at sale time.

## How Solar Affects Your Sale Process

### Listing Your Home:

**Highlight solar as a feature:**
- "Owned 8kW solar system"
- "Average electric bill: $12/month"
- "Annual production: 11,000 kWh"
- "Panels under warranty until 2048"

**Avoid:**
- Hiding that it's leased (if applicable)
- Overstating savings
- Unclear ownership status

### Pricing Your Home:

| System Status | Pricing Impact |
|---------------|----------------|
| Owned outright | Add $15,000-30,000 to value |
| Owned with small loan balance | Add value minus payoff |
| Leased | Neutral to slightly negative |

### Buyer Questions to Expect:

- "Is the system owned or leased?"
- "What are the average monthly savings?"
- "How old is the system?"
- "What warranties remain?"
- "Will I need to assume any payments?"

Be prepared with clear answers.

## Documents to Gather Before Listing

**For owned systems:**
- Original contract
- System specifications
- Production data (from monitoring)
- Warranty documentation
- Permit records
- Utility net metering agreement
- Maintenance records

**For leased/PPA:**
- All of the above, plus:
- Current lease/PPA agreement
- Remaining term
- Monthly payment amount
- Transfer requirements
- Buyout terms

---

## The Utility Transfer Process

### What the Buyer Does:

1. Contacts utility before or shortly after closing
2. Requests transfer of net metering agreement
3. Provides proof of ownership
4. Utility updates account

### Timeline:
2-4 weeks typically

### NEM Status:
- NEM 2.0 customers: Grandfathered status MAY transfer (check utility rules)
- NEM 3.0 customers: Terms lock in for 9 years from interconnection—transfers with system

---

## Special Situations

### Selling Before System Payoff

If your loan balance exceeds system value:
- You may need to bring money to closing
- Or negotiate with buyer
- System can't have negative equity on title

**Example:**
- System value: $15,000
- Loan balance: $22,000
- Gap: $7,000 you'd need to cover

This is rare but possible with recent installations or unfavorable financing.

### Selling Shortly After Installation

If you installed solar very recently:
- Full value may not be recognized by appraisers
- Buyers may be skeptical of savings claims
- Consider waiting 1-2 years if possible

### Divorce or Inheritance

Solar systems are property assets:
- Divided like other home equity in divorce
- Transfer with property in estate planning
- Consult attorney for specific situations

## Tips for a Smooth Solar Home Sale

### Do:
- Gather all documentation early
- Know your ownership/payment status
- Calculate actual savings to share
- Be transparent about lease terms
- Consider paying off small loan balances

### Don't:
- Hide that system is leased

- Ignore transfer requirements

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Owned systems increase home value** by 4-6% and transfer simply
- **Loans are paid off at closing** from sale proceeds—straightforward
- **Leases require buyer assumption** or buyout—can complicate sales
- **Solar homes sell faster** and for more money
- **Document everything** to make transfer smooth
- **Buy vs. lease** partly for easier eventual sale

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will the buyer get my NEM 2.0 rates?
Depends on utility rules. Some allow transfer of grandfathered NEM status; others don't. Check with your utility.

### What if the buyer doesn't want solar?
Rare, but possible. For owned systems, it's part of the house—they can't refuse it without negotiating removal. For leased, they must assume or you must resolve.

### Can I take my solar panels with me?
Technically possible but rarely practical. Removal, transport, and reinstallation costs often exceed the system's value. Better to sell with the house and install new at your next home.

### Does solar affect appraisal?
Yes, positively for owned systems. However, appraisers vary in how they value solar. Provide documentation of system value and savings to help.

### What if my lease has 15 years remaining?
You'll need a buyer willing to assume 15 years of payments—harder than shorter terms. Consider buyout if economically feasible.

### Do I need to disclose the solar system?
Yes. Solar systems must be disclosed, including ownership status, payments, warranties, and any liens.
