# Hidden Costs of NOT Going Solar in Puerto Rico

**Most Puerto Rico homeowners focus on the cost of going solar — but the real financial threat is the cost of doing nothing. Between LUMA rates averaging 24+ cents per kWh, 150+ hours of annual outages, spoiled food, generator fuel, lost work, and declining home competitiveness, staying grid-dependent could cost your household $40,000 to $70,000 or more over the next decade.**

---

## Key Takeaways

- **LUMA residential rates sit roughly 46% above the U.S. mainland average** — and proposed increases could push bills even higher by 2027.
- **Puerto Rico households face 150+ hours of projected power interruptions per year**, costing families hundreds in spoiled food, lost wages, and generator fuel every single outage event.
- **Homes with solar-plus-battery systems can add 4–10% to their property value** while qualifying for a 100% property tax exemption on the added value under Puerto Rico law.
- **Every dollar paid to LUMA is gone forever** — while every dollar put toward a solar system builds equity in an asset you own.
- **Solar eliminates the hidden health, safety, and mental health costs** of living in a home that loses power for days at a time in tropical heat.

## The Real Cost of LUMA Dependence

When people talk about solar, the conversation almost always starts with the sticker price. How much do the panels cost? What are the monthly payments? Is the return on investment worth it?

But there is a question almost nobody asks — and it is arguably more important:

**What is it costing you right now to NOT have solar?**

For Puerto Rico homeowners, the answer is staggering. The cost of grid dependence is not a single line item on your LUMA bill. It is a web of direct charges, indirect losses, and invisible costs that quietly drain your household finances, your health, and your peace of mind month after month, year after year.

Let us break down every one of them.

## Rising LUMA Rates: A Trend That Only Goes One Direction

### Where Rates Stand Today

According to the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/state/data.php?sid=RQ), Puerto Rico's average residential electricity rate is approximately **24.36 cents per kilowatt hour** — roughly **46% higher** than the nationwide average of 16.73 cents. For a household consuming 800–1,000 kWh per month, that translates to monthly bills between $195 and $245 before any surcharges or fuel adjustments.

And those numbers are moving in only one direction.

### The Rate Increase Pipeline

In 2025, [LUMA submitted a rate case](https://lumapr.com/rate-case-2025/?lang=en) to the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau (PREB) proposing an average residential bill increase of $19.16 per month — an increase that, if approved, takes effect in early 2026. That is on top of fuel adjustment charges that fluctuate with global oil and natural gas markets, which Puerto Rico depends on for the majority of its electricity generation.

Over the past decade, Puerto Rico electricity rates have climbed an average of **3–5% per year**. At that pace, a household paying $220 per month today could be paying:

| Year | Estimated Monthly Bill (3% increase) | Estimated Monthly Bill (5% increase) |
|------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 2026 | $227 | $231 |
| 2028 | $240 | $255 |
| 2030 | $255 | $281 |
| 2035 | $295 | $359 |

Over 10 years, that is **$28,000 to $35,000 or more** in electricity payments alone — money you will never see again.

With a solar system, that trajectory flatlines. Your energy cost becomes predictable, low, and in many cases, eliminated entirely.

## The Outage Tax: What Every Blackout Actually Costs You

### Puerto Rico's Outage Reality

This is not hypothetical. According to [LUMA's own resource adequacy reports](https://lumapr.com/news/new-resource-adequacy-report-lack-of-reliable-power-supply-from-generators-will-pose-ongoing-threat-to-service-reliability-in-2025/?lang=en), Puerto Rico customers were projected to experience **154 hours of service interruptions** between mid-2024 and mid-2025 — spread across approximately 36 days. The [EIA confirmed](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65925) that even without hurricanes, Puerto Rico customers lose an average of 27 hours of power per year, compared to roughly 2 hours for mainland U.S. customers.

When hurricanes and major weather events are included, that number jumps past **73 hours annually** — and individual storms can leave communities without power for days or weeks.

Every one of those hours costs you real money.

### Spoiled Food: $150–$400 Per Extended Outage

A refrigerator without power begins losing safe food temperatures within 4 hours. A full freezer lasts about 48 hours if kept closed — less in Puerto Rico's tropical heat. After a multi-day outage, most families lose between $150 and $400 in groceries. Multiply that by 3–5 significant outage events per year, and you are looking at **$450 to $2,000 annually** in food waste alone.

### Generator Fuel: $50–$100 Per Day

Many Puerto Rico families have invested in portable generators as their backup plan. But generators are expensive to operate. Running a mid-size portable generator for 8–12 hours per day costs between **$50 and $100 in fuel** — and during extended outages, fuel becomes scarce and prices spike. A single week-long outage can burn through **$350 to $700** in gasoline or diesel.

Over a year with multiple outage events, generator fuel can easily cost **$1,000 to $3,000** — and that does not include the cost of the generator itself, maintenance, or eventual replacement.

### Lost Wages and Productivity

When the power goes out, work stops. Remote workers cannot connect. Small business owners operating from home lose revenue. Parents may need to stay home with children whose schools have closed. The economic cost of each outage day varies by household, but estimates from the Department of Energy place the average residential cost of a sustained power interruption at **$50–$150 per event** in lost productivity and disrupted routines.

### The Cumulative Outage Tax

Add it all up, and a single year of Puerto Rico's grid instability can cost a household:

- Spoiled food: $450–$2,000
- Generator fuel: $1,000–$3,000
- Lost wages/productivity: $500–$1,500
- Equipment damage from surges: $200–$500

**Total annual "outage tax": $2,150–$7,000**

That is money a solar-plus-battery system would have saved you — while keeping your lights on, your food cold, and your family comfortable.

## Health and Safety Costs You Cannot Put a Price On

### Heat Exposure Without AC

Puerto Rico's average temperature hovers between 80–90 degrees Fahrenheit for much of the year, with humidity levels that push the heat index well into dangerous territory. When the power goes out, air conditioning goes with it.

For elderly residents, young children, and anyone with chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, prolonged heat exposure is not just uncomfortable — it is medically dangerous. Heat-related emergency room visits and hospitalizations spike during extended outages, and the out-of-pocket costs of those medical events can reach into the thousands.

### Medical Equipment Failures

Thousands of Puerto Rico households rely on electrically powered medical equipment — CPAP machines, oxygen concentrators, nebulizers, insulin refrigeration, and home dialysis systems. A power outage is not an inconvenience for these families. It is a life-threatening emergency.

Even for households without critical medical equipment, the inability to keep medications refrigerated or operate basic health devices creates real risk during every extended outage.

### The Cost of Carbon Monoxide

Portable generators cause carbon monoxide poisoning incidents every hurricane season. The CDC has documented spikes in CO poisoning deaths and hospitalizations in Puerto Rico following major storms — a direct consequence of running generators indoors or in poorly ventilated areas. A solar battery system sitting quietly on your wall produces zero emissions and zero risk.

## Property Value: What Your Home Is Losing Without Solar

The real estate market has spoken clearly on this issue. National research shows that homes with solar energy systems sell for approximately **$5,911 more per installed kilowatt** of solar capacity. For a typical 8 kW residential system, that is a potential value increase of **$47,000 or more**.

In Puerto Rico specifically, the equation is even more compelling. According to [real estate analysis from Christie's Puerto Rico](https://christiesrealestatepr.com/blog/predictions-for-puerto-rico-real-estate-trends), properties with sustainable upgrades — including solar and battery systems — can command a **10–20% value premium** over comparable homes without them.

And here is the detail that makes Puerto Rico unique: **Puerto Rico law provides a 100% property tax exemption for the value added to a home by a solar energy system.** You get the equity increase without the tax increase. That is a benefit that does not exist in most mainland states.

Every year you wait, you are competing in a real estate market where an increasing number of homes offer energy independence as a feature. A home that depends entirely on LUMA is becoming a harder sell — especially to buyers who have lived through the outage reality.

## The Opportunity Cost: Where Your LUMA Payments Could Be Going

This is the cost that most people never calculate, and it may be the most significant of all.

Every month, you write a check (or set up autopay) to LUMA Energy. That money leaves your household permanently. It builds no equity. It creates no asset. It gives you no leverage against future rate increases. It is, in every financial sense, **rent for electricity**.

Now consider the alternative. If you redirect that same monthly amount toward a solar energy system — especially through a $0-down financing option like what [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com) offers — you are doing something fundamentally different. You are:

- **Building equity** in a physical asset attached to your property
- **Locking in** your energy cost for 25+ years
- **Increasing** your home's resale value
- **Eliminating** your vulnerability to rate hikes and fuel surcharges
- **Creating** backup power that works when the grid fails

Over 25 years, a Puerto Rico household will pay LUMA an estimated **$70,000 to $100,000+** in electricity costs at current rate trajectories. A solar-plus-battery system that costs a fraction of that amount — and pays for itself within 5–8 years — is not an expense. It is one of the smartest financial moves available to homeowners on the island.

The question is not "Can I afford to go solar?" The question is "Can I afford to keep paying LUMA for 25 more years?"

## The Emotional Toll of Grid Dependence

There is one more cost that does not appear on any spreadsheet, but every Puerto Rico homeowner knows it intimately: **the stress of not knowing when the power will go out or when it will come back.**

The anxiety of checking your phone during every rainstorm. The frustration of throwing away a freezer full of food — again. The helplessness of watching your elderly parent sweat through a 90-degree night without air conditioning. The anger of paying a higher bill every month for a service that fails regularly.

This is not a minor quality-of-life issue. Studies consistently link unreliable infrastructure to elevated stress, anxiety, and diminished mental health outcomes. Puerto Rico residents have endured this reality for years — and for many, it has become normalized.

It should not be normal.

A solar-plus-battery system does not just change your electricity bill. It changes how you feel in your own home. It gives you the confidence that when the grid goes down — and it will go down — your family is protected. Your food stays cold. Your medical equipment stays running. Your children can do their homework. Your home stays safe.

That peace of mind is not a luxury. It is something every Puerto Rico family deserves.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does the average Puerto Rico household spend on electricity per year?

At current rates of approximately 24.36 cents per kWh, a household using 800–1,000 kWh per month spends roughly $2,340 to $2,920 per year on electricity. When you add outage-related costs like spoiled food, generator fuel, and lost productivity, the true annual cost can reach $4,500 to $10,000 or more.

### Are LUMA electricity rates going to keep increasing?

All available evidence says yes. LUMA submitted a rate case in 2025 requesting an average increase of $19.16 per month for residential customers. Puerto Rico's electricity rates have historically risen 3–5% annually, and the island's dependence on imported fossil fuels for power generation makes it especially vulnerable to global energy price fluctuations.

### Does solar really increase home value in Puerto Rico?

Yes. National studies show solar adds approximately $5,911 per installed kilowatt to home value. In Puerto Rico, properties with sustainable energy upgrades can see 10–20% value premiums. Additionally, Puerto Rico law provides a 100% property tax exemption on the value added by solar installations, so you gain the equity without higher taxes.

### What happens during a power outage if I have solar panels but no battery?

Solar panels alone will shut down during a grid outage for safety reasons — this is a standard feature called anti-islanding. To maintain power during blackouts, you need a solar-plus-battery system. RIV Solar designs and installs complete solar-plus-battery systems that automatically switch to backup power when the grid fails, keeping your essential loads running.

### Can I go solar in Puerto Rico with no money down?

Yes. RIV Solar offers $0-down financing options that allow homeowners to start saving immediately without any upfront investment. In many cases, your monthly solar payment is equal to or less than what you are currently paying LUMA — with the critical difference that solar payments build equity in an asset you own, while LUMA payments are gone forever.
