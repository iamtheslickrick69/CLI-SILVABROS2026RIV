# LUMA vs Solar: Take Control of Your Puerto Rico Power

**LUMA Energy has become synonymous with high bills, frequent outages, and broken promises.** Puerto Ricans are tired of paying some of the highest electricity rates in America for some of the worst service. Solar + battery offers a way out.

Here's why thousands of Puerto Rican families are switching to solar.

## The LUMA Problem

Since taking over Puerto Rico's electrical grid in 2021, LUMA Energy has faced widespread criticism:

### By the Numbers

| Metric | LUMA Reality |
|--------|--------------|
| Average Rate | $0.27-0.35/kWh |
| Monthly Outages Reported | 2,800+ |
| Rate Increase Since 2019 | +58% |
| Customer Satisfaction | Among lowest in US |
| Grid Reliability | Frequent failures |

### What Puerto Ricans Experience

- **Blackouts:** Unexpected outages, sometimes lasting hours or days
- **Brown-outs:** Voltage fluctuations damaging appliances
- **Bill shock:** Unpredictable, rising monthly charges
- **Poor service:** Long wait times, unresolved complaints
- **No alternatives:** LUMA is the only option... until solar

## Solar: Your Path to Energy Independence

Solar + battery doesn't just save money — it gives you control over your own power.

### What Solar Provides

| LUMA Experience | Solar + Battery |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| $0.27-0.35/kWh | $0.08-0.12/kWh effective |
| Frequent outages | Backup power always ready |
| Rising rates | Locked-in cost for 25+ years |
| No control | You own your power |
| Dependency | Independence |

### Real Numbers

For a typical Puerto Rico home using 1,000 kWh/month:

| Scenario | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|
| LUMA Only | $270-350 |
| Solar (no battery) | $80-120 |
| Solar + Battery | $100-140 |
| **Savings** | **$150-250/month** |

## Why Battery Storage Is Essential in PR

While solar panels reduce your bills, **battery storage is critical in Puerto Rico** for one reason: grid reliability.

### The Hurricane Factor

Remember Hurricane Maria (2017)?

- **Duration without power:** Some areas 11+ months
- **Deaths attributed to power loss:** Estimated 1,400+
- **Economic damage:** $90 billion+

And it's not just hurricanes. LUMA's grid fails regularly from:
- Equipment failures
- Maintenance issues
- Overloaded circuits
- Weather events

### What Battery Backup Provides

1. **Instant backup:** Automatic switch when grid fails
2. **Extended runtime:** 24-48+ hours on essentials
3. **Daily cycling:** Store solar for evening use
4. **Peace of mind:** Never worry about LUMA outages

### Essential Loads You Can Power

- Refrigerator (keep food safe)
- Lights (safety and comfort)
- Phone/device charging (communication)
- Medical equipment (insulin pumps, CPAP, etc.)
- Fans/AC (survive tropical heat)
- Well pump (if applicable)

## The Economics: LUMA vs Solar

### 25-Year Comparison

| Factor | LUMA Only | Solar + Battery |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Year 1 Cost | $3,600 | $2,400* |
| Year 10 Cost | $5,800** | $2,400 |
| Year 25 Cost | $11,000** | $2,400 |
| **25-Year Total** | **$175,000+** | **$60,000** |
| **Savings** | — | **$115,000+** |

*After financing
**Assuming 5% annual rate increases

### Payback Period

With LUMA's high rates, solar pays for itself faster than almost anywhere in the US:

- **Typical payback:** 4-6 years
- **After payback:** 20+ years of nearly free electricity
- **Total ROI:** 300-500%

## Real Puerto Rico Solar Stories

### The González Family, Bayamón

*"Después de María, estuvimos 8 meses sin luz. Nunca más. Con solar y batería, cuando LUMA falla, ni nos enteramos."*

"After Maria, we were without power for 8 months. Never again. With solar and battery, when LUMA fails, we don't even notice."

- System: 10 kW solar + 26 kWh battery
- Previous LUMA bill: $320/month
- Current bill: $12/month (minimum charge)
- Outages experienced: Zero (battery covers all)

### María Torres, Ponce

*"Mi mamá necesita oxígeno. No podemos depender de LUMA. El sistema solar nos da tranquilidad."*

"My mom needs oxygen. We can't depend on LUMA. The solar system gives us peace of mind."

- System: 8 kW solar + 13.5 kWh battery
- Medical equipment: Always powered
- Savings: $200/month
