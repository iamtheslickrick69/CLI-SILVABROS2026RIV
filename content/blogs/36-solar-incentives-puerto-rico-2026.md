# Solar Incentives Puerto Rico 2026: Complete Guide

**Puerto Rico offers some of the most valuable solar incentives in the entire United States.** Between federal tax credits, local exemptions, net metering extended through 2030, and potential grants up to $15,000, going solar in PR has never been more attractive.

Here's every Puerto Rico solar incentive available in 2026.

## Federal Solar Tax Credit (ITC)

As a US territory, Puerto Rico residents qualify for the full federal Investment Tax Credit:

| Year | Tax Credit |
|------|------------|
| 2024-2032 | **30%** |
| 2033 | 26% |
| 2034 | 22% |
| 2035+ | 0% (expires) |

### How It Works

The ITC is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in your federal income tax:

- System cost: $30,000
- 30% credit: $9,000
- Your federal tax: Reduced by $9,000

**Important for PR residents:** You must have federal tax liability to claim the credit. Most Puerto Rico residents who work for US companies or have mainland income qualify.

### Carryover

If your credit exceeds your tax liability:
- Unused portion carries forward
- Can be claimed over multiple years
- No expiration on carryforward

## Puerto Rico Property Tax Exemption

**100% exemption** on the added value of solar systems:

- Solar increases home value ~4%
- Added value is NOT taxed
- Applies for the life of the system
- No application required — automatic

### Example

| Factor | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Home value before solar | $200,000 |
| Solar system value | $30,000 |
| Home value after solar | $230,000 |
| Taxable value | $200,000 (unchanged) |

## Puerto Rico Sales Tax Exemption

**Full exemption** from Puerto Rico's 4% sales tax (IVU) on solar equipment:

- Solar panels: Exempt
- Inverters: Exempt
- Batteries: Exempt
- Mounting hardware: Exempt

### Savings

- System cost: $30,000
- Normal IVU (4%): $1,200
- With exemption: $0
- **You save: $1,200**

## Net Metering Extended Through 2030

**This is huge.** While mainland states like California have gutted net metering, Puerto Rico *extended* its generous policy through at least 2030.

### What This Means

| Metric | Puerto Rico | California (NEM 3.0) |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Export Credit | **1:1 retail** | ~25% retail |
| Policy Duration | **Guaranteed to 2030** | Subject to change |
| Battery Required? | No (but recommended) | Essentially yes |

Governor Pierluisi signed legislation protecting net metering, making PR one of the most solar-friendly places in the US.

### How It Works

1. Your panels produce excess during the day
2. Excess flows to LUMA's grid
3. You receive credits at full retail rate (~$0.27-0.32/kWh)
4. Use credits at night or during outages
5. Pay only for net usage

## Compare: Puerto Rico vs. Mainland States

| Grant Programs | Up to $15K | Limited | Limited |

Puerto Rico's incentive package is among the most valuable in the entire US, especially when combined with LUMA's extremely high electricity rates.

## The LUMA Factor

Puerto Rico's electricity situation makes solar even more valuable:

| Factor | LUMA Reality |
|--------|--------------|
| Avg Rate | $0.27-0.35/kWh |
| Reliability | Frequent outages |
| Rate Trend | Increasing |
