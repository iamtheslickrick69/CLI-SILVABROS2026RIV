# What Is the 30% Federal Solar Tax Credit? Florida Eligibility Guide

**The 30% federal solar tax credit (also called the Investment Tax Credit or ITC) lets Florida homeowners deduct 30 percent of their total solar installation cost directly from their federal income taxes. Systems installed between 2022 and 2032 qualify for the full 30%, and the credit covers solar panels, battery storage, and related equipment.**

---

## Key Takeaways

- **The federal solar tax credit covers 30% of your entire solar installation cost**, including panels, batteries, inverters, wiring, labor, permits, and sales tax paid on equipment.
- **Florida homeowners are fully eligible** for the ITC with no state-level cap or income restriction on the federal credit.
- **The 30% rate holds through December 31, 2032**, then drops to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 before expiring for residential systems in 2035.
- **You can combine the federal ITC with Florida's sales tax exemption and property tax exemption** on solar, creating one of the strongest incentive stacks in the country.
- **The credit is nonrefundable but can roll forward** --- if your tax liability is less than the credit amount, you can carry the unused portion into the following tax year.

## What Is the Federal Solar Tax Credit (ITC)?

The federal solar Investment Tax Credit, established under the Internal Revenue Code Section 25D, is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the federal income taxes you owe. It is not a deduction (which only reduces taxable income) --- it is a **direct credit** subtracted from your tax bill.

Here is a simple example. If you install a solar energy system in Florida that costs $28,000, the 30% ITC gives you an $8,400 federal tax credit. If you owe $10,000 in federal income taxes for the year, your tax bill drops to $1,600.

The ITC was originally introduced in 2006, expanded multiple times, and most recently extended and enhanced by the **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022**. That legislation locked in the 30% rate for a full decade, giving Florida homeowners a long but not unlimited window to take advantage.

### Who Qualifies?

The ITC is available to any U.S. taxpayer who:

- Owns a solar energy system (leased systems do not qualify for the homeowner; the leasing company claims the credit)
- Installs the system on a property they own in the United States (Florida qualifies; Puerto Rico has separate rules)
- Has sufficient federal tax liability to use the credit (or can carry it forward)
- Uses the system as a residence --- primary or secondary homes qualify, but rental properties claimed under Section 25D do not (rental properties may qualify under the separate Section 48 commercial credit)

There is **no income cap** on the residential ITC. Whether you earn $60,000 or $600,000, you are eligible for the same 30% credit.

## How the 30% Solar Tax Credit Works in Florida

Florida is one of the best states in the country for solar savings, and the federal ITC is the centerpiece. Here is how the credit works in practice for a Florida homeowner.

### Step 1: Install a Qualifying System

You work with a licensed solar installer --- like [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com) --- to design and install a system on your home. The system must be **new** (used equipment does not qualify) and must be placed in service during the tax year you intend to claim the credit.

"Placed in service" means the system is fully installed, connected, and generating electricity. The date the system begins operating --- not the date you sign a contract or make a payment --- determines which tax year applies.

### Step 2: Calculate Your Total Eligible Costs

Add up every qualifying cost associated with the installation (more on what qualifies in the next section). For a typical Florida residential system with battery storage, total costs often range from $25,000 to $45,000 before incentives.

### Step 3: Multiply by 30%

Take your total eligible cost and multiply by 0.30. That is your federal tax credit.

| System Cost | 30% ITC Value |
|---|---|
| $20,000 | $6,000 |
| $28,000 | $8,400 |
| $35,000 | $10,500 |
| $42,000 | $12,600 |

### Step 4: Apply the Credit When You File Taxes

You claim the credit using **IRS Form 5695** (Residential Energy Credits) when you file your federal tax return. The credit reduces your tax owed dollar for dollar. If the credit exceeds your tax liability for the year, the unused amount rolls forward to the next tax year.

### A Note on $0-Down Financing

Many Florida homeowners go solar with $0 out of pocket through solar loans. The ITC still applies --- you claim the credit based on the **full system cost**, not just what you have paid so far. This means you can often use the credit to pay down loan principal early, reducing your monthly payments. At RIV Solar, our team walks every customer through this process so nothing gets left on the table.

## Federal Solar Tax Credit Step-Down Schedule

The Inflation Reduction Act set a clear timeline for the residential ITC:

| Installation Year | Credit Percentage |
|---|---|
| 2022 -- 2032 | **30%** |
| 2033 | **26%** |
| 2034 | **22%** |
| 2035 and beyond | **0%** (residential credit expires) |

This means a Florida homeowner who installs a $30,000 system in 2026 receives a $9,000 credit. The same system installed in 2033 would yield $7,800 --- a $1,200 difference. By 2035, the residential credit disappears entirely.

The lesson is straightforward: the financial case for going solar in Florida is strongest right now while the 30% rate is locked in. Waiting does not make the numbers better.

## What Costs Qualify for the Solar Tax Credit?

The IRS defines eligible costs broadly. For a Florida residential solar installation, the following typically qualify:

### Qualified Equipment and Labor

- **Solar panels (photovoltaic modules)** --- the panels themselves
- **Inverters** --- string inverters, microinverters, or power optimizers
- **Battery storage systems** --- must have a capacity of at least 3 kilowatt-hours (kWh); this was added by the Inflation Reduction Act and is a major benefit for Florida homeowners who want backup power during hurricane season
- **Mounting hardware and racking** --- the structural components that attach panels to your roof or ground mount
- **Wiring and electrical components** --- conduit, disconnects, breaker panels, and monitoring systems
- **Installation labor** --- the cost of the crew physically installing the system
- **Permitting and inspection fees** --- local building permits and interconnection fees
- **Sales tax on equipment** --- though Florida exempts solar equipment from sales tax, if you paid sales tax on any component, that amount qualifies
- **Energy storage integration costs** --- electrical work to connect batteries to your home's panel

### What Does NOT Qualify

- Roof repairs or replacement (even if done to support panels)
- Tree removal to reduce shading
- Landscaping
- Extended warranties purchased separately from the installation contract
- Grid connection fees charged by the utility (in most cases)

At RIV Solar, our proposals clearly itemize every cost so you know exactly what counts toward your ITC calculation. No guesswork, no surprises.

## How to Claim the Solar Tax Credit on Your Taxes

Filing for the ITC is simpler than most people expect. Here is the process step by step.

### 1. Gather Your Documentation

After your system is installed and operational, your solar installer should provide:

- A **final invoice** showing the total cost of the system
- A **commissioning or interconnection confirmation** proving the system was placed in service
- **Equipment specifications** (especially for battery storage, confirming the 3 kWh minimum)

Keep these documents with your tax records. The IRS does not require you to submit them with your return, but you need them if audited.

### 2. Complete IRS Form 5695

When preparing your federal tax return, fill out **Part I of Form 5695** (Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit). You will enter:

- The total qualifying cost of your solar energy system
- The calculated 30% credit amount

The credit flows from Form 5695 to **Schedule 3 (Form 1040)**, Line 5, and then to your Form 1040.

### 3. Apply Against Your Tax Liability

The credit reduces your federal tax owed. If you typically get a refund, the ITC will likely increase that refund. If you typically owe, the ITC will reduce or eliminate what you owe.

### 4. Carry Forward If Needed

If your credit exceeds your tax liability, the unused portion rolls forward. For example, if your ITC is $9,000 but your federal tax liability is only $6,000 this year, you carry the remaining $3,000 to next year.

**Important:** Consult a qualified tax professional for advice specific to your situation. RIV Solar provides general guidance and documentation, but we are solar experts, not tax advisors.

## Combining the Federal ITC with Florida's Solar Exemptions

Here is where Florida homeowners get a real advantage. The state offers two powerful exemptions that stack on top of the federal tax credit.

### Florida Solar Sales Tax Exemption

Florida law (Section 212.08, Florida Statutes) exempts solar energy systems from the state's 6% sales tax. On a $30,000 system, that saves roughly **$1,800** that you would otherwise pay.

This exemption is automatic --- your installer should not charge you sales tax on qualifying solar equipment and labor.

### Florida Solar Property Tax Exemption

Under Section 193.624, Florida Statutes, the added value that a solar energy system brings to your home is **100% exempt from property taxes**. Studies consistently show that solar increases home value by 3--4%, but in Florida, you will not pay a dime more in property taxes because of it.

### The Full Florida Solar Incentive Stack

Here is what the combined savings look like for a $30,000 system:

| Incentive | Savings |
|---|---|
| 30% Federal ITC | $9,000 |
| FL Sales Tax Exemption (6%) | ~$1,800 |
| FL Property Tax Exemption | Ongoing (varies by home value) |
| **Net Cost After Federal Credit** | **$21,000** |

Add in utility savings of $150--$250 per month (common in Florida given high electricity rates and abundant sunshine), and most homeowners see a full return on investment within 6--8 years --- with the system continuing to produce power for 25 years or more.

No state rebate program exists in Florida as of 2026, but the combination of the federal credit and state exemptions makes the economics compelling without one.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid with the Solar Tax Credit

Over the years, we have seen Florida homeowners leave money on the table or run into problems by making avoidable errors. Here are the most common.

### 1. Confusing a Tax Credit with a Tax Deduction

A **credit** reduces your tax bill dollar for dollar. A **deduction** only reduces your taxable income. The ITC is a credit, which is far more valuable. If someone tells you solar is "tax deductible," they are using the wrong term --- and the distinction matters.

### 2. Claiming the Credit in the Wrong Year

The credit applies for the tax year in which the system is **placed in service** (operational), not when you sign a contract or make a down payment. If your system is installed in December 2026 but not turned on until January 2027, the credit belongs on your 2027 return.

### 3. Not Carrying Forward Unused Credit

If your tax liability is less than your credit amount, do not assume you lose the difference. File Form 5695 for the full amount and carry the excess forward. Some homeowners forget this and forfeit thousands of dollars.

### 4. Leasing Instead of Owning

If you lease a solar system, the leasing company --- not you --- claims the ITC. Ownership (including financing with a solar loan) is the only way for a homeowner to capture the credit. At RIV Solar, all of our $0-down financing options are structured so that **you own the system and you get the tax credit**.

### 5. Forgetting Battery Storage Qualifies

Since the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, standalone battery storage systems (3 kWh minimum) qualify for the 30% credit. If you installed solar before 2022 and now want to add a battery, the battery cost qualifies on its own. Many Florida homeowners are adding batteries for hurricane resilience and claiming the credit.

### 6. Not Working with an Experienced Installer

Your installer's documentation directly affects your ability to claim the credit. Incomplete invoices, missing commissioning dates, or unclear cost breakdowns can create problems at tax time. Choose a company that understands the ITC process from start to finish.

## Getting Started with the Federal Solar Tax Credit in Florida

If you are a Florida homeowner considering solar, here is a practical path forward.

1. **Get a personalized solar proposal.** Every home is different. Your roof orientation, electricity usage, shading, and utility rate all affect system size and savings. [RIV Solar](https://rivsolar.com) provides free, no-pressure consultations with detailed proposals --- in English or Spanish.

2. **Understand your financing options.** Whether you pay cash or use $0-down financing, you own the system and qualify for the full 30% ITC. Our team explains every option transparently so you can choose what fits your budget.

3. **Review the timeline.** From signing a contract to system activation, a typical RIV Solar installation takes 6--10 weeks depending on permitting in your county. Plan ahead so your system is operational in the tax year you want to claim the credit.

4. **Save your documentation.** Keep your final invoice, interconnection letter, and equipment specs in a safe place. You will need them at tax time.

5. **File your taxes with the credit.** Use IRS Form 5695 or share the documentation with your tax preparer. The credit is yours --- do not leave it unclaimed.

RIV Solar has helped thousands of Florida homeowners go solar with $0 down, in-house installation crews, a 25-year warranty, and bilingual support.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much is the federal solar tax credit in Florida in 2026?

The federal solar tax credit in Florida is 30% of the total cost of your solar energy system for installations completed between 2022 and 2032. For a typical $30,000 system, this means a $9,000 credit applied directly to your federal income taxes. Florida has no additional state-level solar tax credit, but the federal ITC combined with Florida's sales tax and property tax exemptions creates significant overall savings.

### Can I claim the solar tax credit if I finance my system with a loan?

Yes. If you finance your solar system with a loan, you still own the system and qualify for the full 30% federal tax credit based on the total system cost. You do not need to pay cash upfront. The credit is based on what the system costs, not how you pay for it. Many Florida homeowners use their ITC refund to pay down their solar loan principal.

### What happens if my tax liability is less than my solar tax credit?

If your federal tax liability is less than your solar tax credit amount, you can carry the unused portion forward to the next tax year. For example, if your credit is $9,000 but you only owe $5,500 in federal taxes, you apply $5,500 this year and carry the remaining $3,500 forward. The credit is nonrefundable, meaning the IRS will not send you a check for the difference, but you will not lose it either.

### Does the solar tax credit apply to battery storage in Florida?

Yes. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 expanded the federal solar tax credit to include standalone battery storage systems with a capacity of at least 3 kilowatt-hours. This means Florida homeowners can add a battery to an existing solar system or install solar and battery together, and the battery cost qualifies for the full 30% credit. This is especially valuable in Florida where batteries provide backup power during hurricanes and severe storms.

### When does the 30% solar tax credit expire?

The 30% federal solar tax credit is available for residential systems placed in service through December 31, 2032. It then steps down to 26% in 2033, 22% in 2034, and expires entirely for residential installations in 2035. The key date is when your system becomes operational, not when you sign a contract. To lock in the full 30%, your system must be installed and generating electricity before January 1, 2033.
