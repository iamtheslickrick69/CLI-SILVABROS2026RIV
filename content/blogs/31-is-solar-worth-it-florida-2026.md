Let's break down exactly why solar makes sense in the Sunshine State in 2026.

## Florida Solar: By the Numbers

## Why Solar Works So Well in Florida

### 1. Abundant Sunshine

Florida isn't called the Sunshine State for nothing. With an average of 5.5 peak sun hours per day, your solar panels produce more energy than in most other states. More sun = more savings.

### 2. Rising Utility Rates

FPL (Florida Power & Light), Duke Energy, and TECO have all raised rates significantly:

- **FPL:** Up 38% since 2022
- **Duke Energy:** Up 25% since 2022
- **TECO:** Up 22% since 2022

These increases are projected to continue at 5-7% annually. Solar locks in your rate forever.

### 3. Excellent Incentives

Florida offers some of the best solar incentives in the nation:

- **30% Federal Tax Credit:** Save $8,000-$15,000 on federal taxes
- **Property Tax Exemption:** Solar doesn't increase your property taxes
- **Sales Tax Exemption:** No 6% sales tax on solar equipment
- **Net Metering:** Full retail credit for excess energy

### 4. No State Income Tax

Unlike California, Florida has no state income tax. That means you keep more of your solar savings in your pocket.

## Florida Solar Costs in 2026

The average Florida solar system costs:

- **Before incentives:** $20,000-$35,000
- **After 30% tax credit:** $14,000-$24,500
- **With $0 down financing:** $0 upfront, payments often less than current bill

## Florida Utility Comparison

| Utility | Avg Rate | Customers | Solar Savings |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| FPL | 14.5¢/kWh | 5.8M | $150-180/mo |
| Duke Energy | 13.8¢/kWh | 1.9M | $140-170/mo |
| TECO | 13.2¢/kWh | 800K | $130-160/mo |
